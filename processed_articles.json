        "abstract": "Digital human in cyberspace can help provide humanized services in specific applications, such as question & answer systems, recommender systems, chatter robots, and intelligent assistants. While most researches focus on behavior analytics, few of them integrate the personality that is also a closely related factor. As a classic indicator for personality representation, Myers\u2013Briggs type indicator (MBTI) categorizes an individual into mutually exclusive types from four dichotomous axes (extraversion versus introversion, sensing versus intuition, thinking versus feeling, judging versus perceiving). Traditional recognition method using MBTI simply measures the user\u2019s preference frequency in each axis through questionnaires, treating the dominant value as the identified result. Such a paradigm, however, represents all the people with only 16 types and cannot distinguish heterogeneous users clearly. This article proposes a novel personality recognition method using fuzzy logic. Different from previous classifications, our new method categorizes the individual in a continuous space and represents one\u2019s personality in a more fine-grained level. We have designed comparative psychological tests for 77 people. The validation experiments on such tests indicate that the fuzzy-logic-based method is not only consistent with the classic MBTI tests (in the sense of defuzzification) but also provides the uncertainty for each personality type. Therefore, it can be viewed as a generalization of the classic MBTI tests and promotes the representation of individual\u2019s heterogeneity for fine-grained analytics of digital human.",

        "abstract": "Artificial general intelligence revived in recent years after people achieved significant advances in machine learning and deep learning. This leads to the thinking of how real intelligence could be created. Consciousness theories believe that general intelligence is essentially conscious, yet no universal definition is agreed upon. In this work, global workspace (GW) theory is implemented and integrated with crucial cognitive components. With the focus on episodic memory and inspiration from the nature of episodic memory in psychology and neuroscience, the episodic memory component is implemented within the GW framework. In our experiment, the robotic agent operates in a real-world interactive context, forming episodic memory and demonstrating static, temporal, and context memory capabilities during interactions. Consciousness in this work engages in all formation, maintenance, and retrieval processes of episodic memory. The novelty and contributions of this work are: 1) this work is implementing episodic memory within the consciousness framework, suggesting the sustainable potential of such an integrated approach to cognitive agents with artificial general intelligence (AGI); 2) regarding the limited examples in consciousness-based cognitive architectures, this work attempts to contribute to the diversity of perspectives and approaches; 3) extant episodic memory implementations are suffering from various limitations, while this work summarises some key features for modeling episodic memory within a cognitive architecture; and 4) authors discuss the relationship between episodic memory, consciousness, and general intelligence, proposing the compatibility and relationship between machine consciousness and other AGI research. It is believed that a better alignment between them would further boost the fusion of diverse research for achieving desired cognitive machines.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have provided us with neural networks capable of creating images of astonishing quality, be they realistic, abstract, or even creative. These models have in common that (more or less explicitly) they all aim to produce a high-quality one-off output given certain conditions, and in that they are not well suited for a creative collaboration framework. Drawing on theories from cognitive science that model how professional designers and artists think, we argue how this setting differs from the former and introduce CICADA: a Collaborative, Interactive Context-Aware Drawing Agent. CICADA uses a vector-based synthesis-by-optimisation method to take a partial sketch (such as might be provided by a user) and develop it towards a goal by adding and/or sensibly modifying traces. Given that this topic has been scarcely explored, we also introduce a way to evaluate desired characteristics of a model in this context by means of proposing a diversity measure. CICADA is shown to produce sketches of quality comparable to a human user\u2019s, enhanced diversity and most importantly to be able to cope with change by continuing the sketch minding the user's contributions in a flexible manner.",

        "abstract": "Recently, many researchers have applied Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to multi-label learning tasks by establishing relations among labels. However, these researchers have only used GCN as an auxiliary module and have lacked exploration of object relations, which has limited the inference capability of GCN. Applying GCN to multi-label classification in information systems poses significant challenges to address because information systems are considered as a graph with only nodes and no edges. This article proposes a multi-granularity graph convolutional neural network (MG-GCN) based on object relations to enhance the versatility of GCN and demonstrate its reasoning ability. The MG-GCN efficiently solves complex multi-label classification problems in information systems. Firstly, based on the multi-granularity thinking, the attribute set is divided into several attribute subsets based on granularity. Secondly, a graph of differences representing the relationship between objects is established under each attribute subset. Finally, based on the attention mechanism and multiple difference matrices of objects, MG-GCN is proposed and applied to multi-label classification within information systems. The effectiveness and significance of performance of MG-GCN has been verified through ranking-based indicators and hypothesis tests, respectively.",

A total of 52 Grade 3 students took part in the experiment, of whom 28 assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. The results indicated that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in EL achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produced a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge; 3) their learning anxieties were also lower than those of the control group; and 4) the analysis of behavioral patterns also revealed that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrated better language-learning interaction, while the character-ER board game presented greater CT development in finding solutions.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most popular visual programming languages, Scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions.",

Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.",

To accomplish such efficacious interaction, the next-generation AEI needs comprehensive human emotion models for training. Unlike theory of emotion, which has been the historical focus in psychology, emotion models are a descriptive tool. In practice, the strongest models need robust coverage, which means defining the smallest core set of emotions from which all others can be derived. To achieve the desired coverage, we turn to word embeddings from natural language processing. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, our experiments show that with as few as 15 discrete emotion categories, we can provide maximum coverage across six major languages\u2013Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In support of our findings, we also examine annotations from two large-scale emotion recognition datasets to assess the validity of existing emotion models compared to human perception at scale. Because robust, comprehensive emotion models are foundational for developing real-world affective computing applications, this work has broad implications in social robotics, human-machine interaction, mental healthcare, computational psychology, and entertainment.",

The present work proposes an integrated approach for extensive study with a set of criteria and possible Industry 5.0 enablers in consumer electronics using a novel decision-making approach. The approach comprises of  $T$ -spherical fuzzy information containment/processing through an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and then utilizing the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) sequentially to obtain the necessary weights of selected criteria. Further, the obtained weights from AHP would be used in WASPAS for the computational assessment while finding the prioritization/ranking of industry 5.0 enablers. The results with the sensitivity analysis validate the robustness-cum-resilience of the proposed integrated approach with standard managerial implications and the findings take care of cognitive in the human socio-technical environment. The regulated adoption of Industry 5.0 enablers would help consumer electronics manufacturers in finding optimized solutions.",

        "abstract": "Dexterous robotic grasping gains great benefits from tactile sensation, but delicate object exploration by tactile information is challenged by difficulty in rich and efficient data production. In this letter, we propose a tactile-based in-hand object perception approach, empowered by a sim-to-real approach toward a data-efficient learning process. A high-fidelity tactile input, measured by a pair of vision-based tactile sensors, was represented as a point cloud facilitating dual functionality of object classification and the associated pose estimation. For the classification, we constructed PoinTacNet, a variation of PointNet to fit into tactile data processing. A reliable simulation methodology on tactile input was employed for the pretraining of the model, transferred to the fine-tuning process facing real tactile data. Taking inspiration from human behaviors, a re-grasping strategy was imparted by means of conditional accumulation of class likelihood distribution. The result of the framework facilitates a high object classification accuracy of 83.89$\\%$ on the ten objects from McMaster-Carr's CAD models, which is significantly improved by the re-grasping. In addition, a set of benchmarks displays the computational efficiency in the sim-to-real transfer. In line with the successful classification, the posture of in-hand objects is estimated using point cloud registration algorithms, achieving an average angular and translational RMSE of 5.03$^\\circ$ and 2.41 mm, respectively. The proposed approach has the potential to enable robots to attain human-like haptic exploration skills for perceiving unstructured environments.",

        "abstract": "While computational thinking arises as an essential skill worldwide, formal primary and secondary education in Latin America rarely incorporates mechanisms to develop it in their curricula. The extent to which students in the region acquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start addressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross sectional study that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming students at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines. Based on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant inequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private or no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into how these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a highly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies focused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary initiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten upcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable field for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar circumstances.",

        "abstract": "The computing in the network (COIN) paradigm is a promising solution that leverages unused network resources to perform tasks to meet computation-demanding applications, such as the metaverse. In this vein, we consider the partial computation offloading problem in the metaverse for multiple subtasks in a COIN environment to minimize energy consumption and delay while dynamically adjusting the offloading policy based on the changing computational resource status. The problem is NP-hard, and we transform it into two subproblems: the task-splitting problem (TSP) on the user side and the task-offloading problem (TOP) on the COIN side. We model the TSP as an ordinal potential game and propose a decentralized algorithm to obtain its Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we model the TOP as a Markov decision process and propose the double deep Q-network (DDQN) to solve for the optimal offloading policy. Unlike the conventional DDQN algorithm, where intelligent agents sample offloading decisions randomly within a certain probability, the COIN agent explores the NE of the TSP and the deep neural network. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the proposed model approach allows the COIN agent to update its policies and make more informed decisions, leading to improved performance over time compared to the traditional baseline.",

        "abstract": "Recently, various text-to-image generative models have been released, demonstrating their ability to generate high-quality synthesized images from text prompts. Despite these advancements, determining the appropriate text prompts to obtain desired images remains challenging. The quality of the synthesized images heavily depends on the user input, making it difficult to achieve consistent and satisfactory results. This limitation has sparked the need for an effective prompt optimization method to generate optimized text prompts automatically for text-to-image generative models. Thus, this study proposes a prompt optimization method that uses in-context few-shot learning in a pretrained language model. The proposed approach aims to generate optimized text prompts to guide the image synthesis process by leveraging the available contextual information in a few text examples. The results revealed that synthesized images using the proposed prompt optimization method achieved a higher performance, at 18% on average, based on an evaluation metric that measures the similarity between the generated images and prompts for generation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide a more efficient and automated approach to obtaining high-quality synthesized images. The findings indicate that prompt optimization may offer a promising pathway for text-to-image generative models.",

Here, we quantify the power of Big Tech by analyzing their acquisitions, market capitalization, and number of monthly active users. Moreover, we utilize the synthetic control method to estimate the effect of public scandals on the stock price of two Big Tech companies, and find that they had no lasting effect. We also analyze the number of tweets mentioning these scandals, and find that they quickly fade from the spotlight. To explore public sentiment, we survey 5300 participants across 25 countries, and find that those from countries with lower digital literacy and more authoritarian regimes are more trusting of Big Tech. Furthermore, we find that one in three feels they lack control over the data collected about them, and one in four feels that Big Tech knows what they are thinking, knows more about them than their best friend, and may even be secretly listening to their conversations. Additionally, one in four feels addicted to Big Tech products, have no choice but to use them, and wishes there were more companies to choose from. These findings highlight the adverse effect of the oligopolistic nature of Big Tech on consumer choice and help inform policy-makers aiming to curb their dominance.",

        "abstract": "At present, innovation courses for college students play a vital role in universities. It has also become an important teaching platform for cultivating superior talents. How to improve the level of innovative thinking of college students into high-quality national strategic talents has become a research topic of great concern. However, many university teachers still follow traditional instructional design. It is impossible to implement a customized approach to education. Responding to the deficiencies in the instructional design of innovative training for university students, the support vector machine and K-means clustering algorithms are combined to create a revolutionary network instructional system, which is then used in an undergraduate course. A virtual reality classroom, real-time chat features, and an evaluation system are just a few of the elements that make up this system. It makes it possible to personalize learning, share open data, have real-time debates, and participate in a variety of virtual learning activities. Through the use of conventional datasets, this integrated multi-algorithmic system\u2019s dependability is illustrated. It can meet the diverse learning needs of college students and help solve the weaknesses of traditional instructional design. Since 2022, four evaluation techniques have been used to confirm the efficacy of this teaching strategy: student recognition analysis, final test passing rate, competition winning percentage, and classroom activity level assessment. The results support the following: Compared with the traditional teaching design, the novel network instructional system is more conducive to helping college students cultivate learning interests and enhance their innovative thinking level. The adoption and dissemination of this strategy will undoubtedly advance educational research and improve college students\u2019 capacity for creative thought, fostering the development of top-notch creative talent and advancing sustainable societal development.",

Users think that it is easier to follow the agenda by accessing news, especially on Twitter, rather than newspaper news pages. However, fake news is increasingly appearing on social media, and it is not always possible for people to obtain correct news from partial news pages or short Twitter posts. Understanding whether the news shared on Twitter is true or not is an important problem. Detecting fake tweets is of great importance in Turkish as well as in any language. In this study, fake news obtained from verification platforms on Twitter and real news obtained from the Twitter accounts of mainstream newspapers were labeled and, preprocessed using the Zemberek natural language processing tool developed for the Turkish language, and a dataset named TR_FaRe_News was created. Then, the TR_FaRe_News dataset was explored using ensemble methods and BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec vectorization methods for fake news detection. Then a pre-trained BERT deep learning model was fine-tuned, and variations of the model extended with Bi-LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers with the frozen and unfrozen parameters methods were explored. The performance evaluation was conducted using seven comparable datasets, namely BuzzFeedNews, GossipCop, ISOT, LIAR, Twitter15, and Twitter16, including an LLM-generated fake news dataset. Analyzing Turkish tweets and using fake news datasets generated by LLM is considered an important contribution. Accuracy values between 90 and 94% were obtained with the BERT and BERTurk + CNN models with 94% accuracy.",

The facilities of the IoT devices can be enhanced to support an intelligent application through technologies like fog computing, smart networks, federated learning or explainable artificial intelligence infrastructures. In all these cases networking of IoT devices becomes inevitable. Whereever there exists a network, a threat to the network infrastructure is also possible. The proposed work classifies various attacks on the hosts with the support of proven machine learning (ML) algorithms. This work performs the comparative analysis of all these classification parameters of the machine learning algorithms with the use of fuzzy-based recommendation systems. This work also lists out various incidents of intrusions on the IoT hosts in appropriate layers of the interface and proposes an efficient algorithm and framework to overcome the occurrences of intrusions on the host side. In particular, we propose an effective security framework to deal with the intrusions that can deteriorate the host-based systems. The ranking of the algorithms is evaluated using fuzzy-based recommendation systems such as TOPSIS, VIKOR, MORA, WASPAS. The ensemble of machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Lite Gradient Boost, Xtra Gradient Boost and Random Forest provide better values of accuracy (around 99%) with higher precision, re-call and F1-scores, thus proving their efficacy for intrusion detection in IoT networks.",

However, the sensitivity surrounding suicide-related data poses challenges in accessing large-scale, annotated datasets necessary for training effective machine learning models. To address this limitation, we introduce an innovative strategy that leverages the capabilities of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, Flan-T5, and Llama, to create synthetic data for suicidal ideation detection. Our data generation approach is grounded in social factors extracted from psychology literature and aims to ensure coverage of essential information related to suicidal ideation. In our study, we benchmarked against state-of-the-art NLP classification models, specifically, those centered around the BERT family structures. When trained on the real-world dataset, UMD, these conventional models tend to yield F1-scores ranging from 0.75 to 0.87. Our synthetic data-driven method, informed by social factors, offers consistent F1-scores of 0.82 for both models, suggesting that the richness of topics in synthetic data can bridge the performance gap across different model complexities. Most impressively, when we combined a mere 30% of the UMD dataset with our synthetic data, we witnessed a substantial increase in performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.88 on the UMD test set. Such results underscore the cost-effectiveness and potential of our approach in confronting major challenges in the field, such as data scarcity and the quest for diversity in data representation.",

        "abstract": "This article introduces a novel approach to remote laboratory instruction, specifically designed for teaching three-dimensional modeling using Blender software. The lab uses virtual machines to provide students with the necessary computational power to carry out the course activities, along with the correct version of the software. The flipped remote lab approach combines the elements of flipped classroom and peer assessment, making it suitable for face-to-face, totally online, or hybrid classes. Prior to each of the two lectures, students begin to practice by replicating the instructor's demonstrations in a set of concise tutorials. Upon completion of the assigned tasks, students carry out self-assessments of their own modeling, in addition to assessing two models created by their peers. A rubric comprising three questions facilitates the assessment process and allows providing feedback on each response. During the subsequent lecture, students work together with the instructor to address challenges encountered in their modeling, exploring also the advanced aspects of software usage that time constraints preclude in a traditional setting. The analysis of the flipped remote lab results reveals that student responses in peer-assessment activities are relevant to the posed questions. Moreover, the students who realized the models demonstrated a comparable level of rigor in self-assessment as their mates who reviewed their works. While students express a high degree of appreciation for the laboratory activities, a notable concern is the highlighted heavy workload. Increasing the allocated time for task completion can help mitigate the workload impact. The article concludes with insights gained from the implementation of the flipped remote lab approach.",

The aim of this research is to develop a smart collaborative robot, where a rapid and accurate robot and a flexible human operator work synergistically to achieve a common objective. In the proposed system, humans and robots work together to tackle the same combinatorial optimization problem; the robot actively engages in problem-solving, while the human has the ability to override the robot's actions if disagreements arise, and to execute alternative actions.

        "abstract": "Smart spaces are physical environments equipped with sensors, actuators, and other computing devices to gather data and provide intelligent services to users. These spaces are made possible by ubiquitous computing, particularly context-aware computing. Although these systems are mainly implemented on mobile and other resource-constrained wearable devices, different techniques have been adopted for their implementation. Rule-based reasoning is a relatively easy-to-implement approach that can solve real-world problems. Rule-based systems rely on a set of assertions that constitute the working memory and a set of rules that govern what should be done with the set of assertions. Despite its relative simplicity, the working memory size is a critical factor in developing these systems, particularly for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose techniques for efficiently calculating the working memory size. Our results show that all three techniques, DWM, APS, and SAPS, performed well in different ways. However, APS and SAPS consumed from 25% to 100% less memory than existing techniques.",

        "abstract": "Contribution: This research illuminates information entropy\u2019s efficacy as a pivotal educational tool in programming, enabling the precise quantification of algorithmic complexity and student abstraction levels for solving P problems. This approach can provide students quantitative, comparative insights into the differences between optimal and student implemented solution, and allowing educators to offer targeted feedback, thereby optimizing the learning and abstraction processes in algorithm design through deliberate practice. Background: Abstraction is considered one of the most impor11 tant skills in problem solving. Many studies in programming have shown that higher abstraction capability can significantly simplify problems, reduce program complexity and improve efficiency. However, it is difficult to develop criteria to measure the level of abstraction, and there is still a lack of relevant systematic research. Research Questions: 1) How can students\u2019 abstraction ability in programming be effectively measured? 2) How to develop programming education and training methods based on the measurement of abstraction ability? Methodology: Forty-six grade 10 students participated in the experiment, divided into two groups for programming train23 ing using information-entropy-based assessment and traditional learning methods. Their level of computational thinking, algo25 rithmic efficiency improvements, and test scores were used to measure performance and to analyze the effectiveness of the training methods. Findings: Through empirical research, this article finds that information-entropy-based assessment can reflect the differences in problem solving among students possessing varying capa31 bilities.

        "abstract": "This study aims to explore the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in art education, assessing its impact on learners\u2019 experiences and learning outcomes. The study first proposes a digital teaching system that enables the IoT and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to play a role in art education by monitoring students\u2019 creative state in real-time, providing immediate feedback, and facilitating the generation of creative works. The system framework includes sensor nodes, an IoT platform, a GAN model, and a user interface to build a real-time interactive environment. Sensor nodes constantly collect physiological, movement, and environmental data from students, and the GAN model receives student data from the IoT platform, combining creative input from students to generate artwork in real-time. The generated works are transmitted to the discriminator through the IoT platform, which evaluates their quality and provides real-time feedback. Students interact with the system through the user interface, observe the generated artwork, adjust generator parameters, and propose new ideas. These interactions influence further artistic creation. The WikiArt public art creation dataset is selected to establish the experimental foundation, and the experimental evaluation focuses on image generation quality, system performance, and student learning outcomes. It is compared with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. The research results indicate that the designed IoT and GANs integrated system remarkably outperforms DCGAN and VAE in image generation quality, with an Inception Score of 4.5, which is more diverse and recognizable than other models. Regarding system performance, the IoT and GANs integrated system is significantly ahead in image generation speed and user interaction, with a transmission speed of up to 200 Mbps. Regarding student learning outcomes, the system performs excellently in emotional feedback, learning outcomes, and creative work quality, achieving 80% satisfaction and 90% positive feedback. Overall, the research conclusion clearly points out that the integration of IoT and GANs has a significant and comprehensive effect on improving the quality of art education. This study expands the field of art education by integrating IoT and GANs, enhancing students\u2019 creative experiences, and providing innovative methods for art teaching in the digital age.",

In this study, we propose a new depth learning method specifically designed for detecting longitudinal tears in conveyor belts. This method employs a linear Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera to capture images of the conveyor belt. These images are subsequently processed with a modified version of You Only Look Once (YOLO)v7 model to identify instances of longitudinal tearing. The modified YOLOv7 model features Efficient Intersection over Union (EIoU) loss function as a substitute for the original loss function. Furthermore, a Simple Parameter-Free Attention Module (SimAM) is introduced in the detection head to improve detection accuracy. In this method, we introduced the SimSPPFCSPC module as a new spatial pyramid pooling model. This module enhances detection speed while maintaining detection accuracy. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an impressive precision of 94.6% and a detection speed of approximately 110 Frames Per Second (FPS). Such accuracy and speed meet the requirements for online detection of longitudinal tearing in belt conveyors.",

Traditional approaches in this area predict the future behavior of dynamical systems by inferring the evolution function. However, these methods may confront obstacles due to the presence of missing variables, which are usually attributed to challenges in measurement and a partial understanding of the system of interest. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce the autoregressive with slack time series (ARS) model, that simultaneously estimates the evolution function and imputes missing variables as a slack time series. Assuming time-invariance and linearity in the (underlying) entire dynamical time series, our experiments demonstrate the ARS model\u2019s capability to forecast future time series. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a 2-dimensional time-invariant and linear system can be reconstructed by utilizing observations from a single, partially observed dimension of the system.",

This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops. There was no significant difference significant difference for the pretest scores of all three workshops. The analysis of the posttest further confirmed that the experimental groups (PBL and GBL) exhibited significant difference in the scores compared to the control group. However, the posttest results did not differ significantly between the experimental groups (PBL and GBL).",

Therefore, the rapid identification of RNA-protein binding sites is crucial for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis. In this work, a new parallel network that integrates the multi-head attention mechanism and the expectation pooling is proposed, named MAHyNet. The left-branch network of MAHyNet hybrids convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent neural network (GRU) to extract the features of one-hot. The right-branch network is a two-layer CNN network to analyze physicochemical properties of RNA base. Specifically, the multi-head attention mechanism is a computational collection of multiple independent layers of attention, which can extract feature information from multiple dimensions. The expectation pooling combines probabilistic thinking with global pooling. This approach helps to reduce model parameters and enhance the model performance. The combination of CNN and GRU enables further extraction of high-level features in sequences. In addition, the study shows that appropriate hyperparameters have a positive impact on the model performance. Physicochemical properties can be used to supplement characterization information to improving model performance. The experimental results show that MAHyNet has better performance than other models.",

        "abstract": "The increasing computational demands of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models, particularly for embedded systems in autonomous vehicles and drones, present significant challenges owing to their extensive neural network complexities. Previous DRL compression strategies predominantly focused on unstructured pruning, effective for reducing model size but requiring specialized hardware for computational acceleration. Conversely, DRL models with structured pruning applied can be accelerated on standard hardware, though they typically encounter performance issues at higher pruning rates due to structural constraints. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced structured pruning methodology, combined with scaled policy constraints (SPC) for DRL models. Our approach overcomes the performance limitations of conventional structured pruning, achieving high pruning rates while maintaining robust model performance. Enhanced performance restoration after pruning is achieved by fine-tuning with SPC and applying structural regularization, thus ensuring efficient decision-making with a minimal computational burden. Extensive evaluations on the D4RL benchmark and in a drone control simulation environment confirm the effectiveness of our method. Our approach maintains performance integrity even at high pruning rates, with less than a 2% decrease in normalized score at 90% pruning in D4RL and preserving cumulative reward at 87% pruning in drone control simulation. Significantly, our approach also enables considerable computational acceleration on standard hardware. We implemented our method on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX board and achieved a 2.5-fold speed-up on devices with NVIDIA Volta GPUs and over double the speed-up on those with NVIDIA Carmel ARMv8.2 CPUs. These outcomes highlight our method\u2019s suitability for real-time, resource-constrained applications, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency.",

A shared control takes advantage of human and computer strengths in decision-making support, and this helps to improve the adaptability, agility, reliability, responsiveness, and resilience of the system. Since the decision spaces for human thinking and machine intelligence are quite different, challenges occur to fuse human intelligence and machine intelligence effectively. A brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) can bridge human and machine intelligence; however, traditional BCIs are unidirectional that support interaction in one of two scenarios: first, human or machine takes effect at different control layers, and second, either human or machine takes effect at a time. There is an emerging need to close the loop of BCI-based control to alleviate the adverse effects of a machine's error or a human's mistake. In this article, available technologies for acquisition, processing, and mining of brain signals are reviewed, the needs of integrating human's capability to control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are elaborated, and research challenges in advancing BCI for a shared human and machine control are discussed at the aspects of data acquisition, mapping of human's and machine's decision spaces, and the fusion of human's and machine's intelligence in automated controls. To address unsolved problems in the aforementioned aspects, we proposed a new platform of using BCI for human\u2013machine interactions and three innovations are, first, an advanced BCI to acquire multimodal brain signals and extract features related to the intentions of motion and the quantified human's affection, second, an arbitrating mechanism in system control to determine the weight of human's decisions based on quantified human's affection, and finally, a decision support system that is capable of fusing human's and machine's decisions from different decision spaces seamlessly in controlling a UAV for real-time performance in application.",

In this work, we propose a novel interaction prediction framework, called GIB-DS, which centers on the identification of the core subgraph in pairs of molecules to anticipate their interaction behavior. Guided by the principles of the Graph Information Bottleneck, our approach adeptly identifies two subgraphs within this pair of graphs that capture the essential information pertinent to the task at hand. We think that the dual-subgraph formulation could more faithfully capture the underlying nature of chemical reactions, where interactions between molecules and the interactions among specific atoms are inherently intertwined. Extensive experimentation across diverse datasets underscores the superiority of GIB-DS over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an approximate 5% improvement.

However, current work still has a large reliance on human input and subjective assessment to label biases. This is especially true for cable news, which has a continued presence in American media but a lack of text-based bias identification in research. To address these issues, we develop an unsupervised machine learning method to characterize the bias of cable news programs without any human input. This method relies on the analysis of what topics are mentioned through Named Entity Recognition and how those topics are discussed through Stance Analysis in order to cluster programs with similar biases together. Applying our method to 2020 cable news transcripts, we find that cable news programs tend to cluster together consistently over time and roughly correspond to the cable news network of the program. This method reveals the potential for future tools to more objectively assess media bias and characterize unfamiliar media environments, and the empirical results insight into the nature of bias in American cable news programs.",

        "abstract": "In advance to the present study, the authors introduced a method which makes it possible to calculate the entropy of natural language digital texts, focusing on word-processed texts, presentations, and webpages. This entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. It was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. This finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses \u2013 the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data \u2013 generated by negligent text management. Furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. To prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group ( $2\\times67$  hours). With this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. To correct documents, we present the Error Recognition Model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. All our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students\u2019 and end-users\u2019 computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability \u2013 beyond hardware and software development and recycling \u2013 with a focus on the human factor. Recently, the Error Recognition Model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified. However, the near future is to run parallel the reactive and proactive uses of this approach, while if we look far into the future, the proactive use to digital born natural language texts should dominate.",

        "abstract": "This study is devoted to exploring the strategy of automatic sketch generation and optimization of industrial design based on deep learning. By combining the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with the optimization algorithm, this paper proposes an innovative method to realize the automatic generation of high-quality and diverse industrial design sketches. In the experiment, this paper selects SketchyCAD and other public data sets, trains them through deep learning model, and introduces genetic algorithm(GA) and differential evolution algorithm to optimize the parameters. In terms of experimental results, we observed that the quality of generated sketches was significantly improved, and the design sketches generated by the mode (GAN+GA) were more realistic and innovative. The introduction of optimization strategy further improves the generation effect and intelligently adjusts the model parameters to adapt to different design styles. In this paper, the influence of hyperparameter tuning is analyzed in detail, and it is found that the adjustment of learning rate plays a key role in generating quality and diversity. However, the experiment also revealed some challenges and room for improvement. We noticed that the generated results may have the risk of over-fitting in the training process, and with the increase of training times, the diversity gradually decreased. This suggests that more complex model structure and richer data sets are needed to improve the generalization performance. Generally speaking, this study provides new ideas and methods for the integration of deep learning and industrial design. By innovatively combining generation model and optimization algorithm, this research has contributed beneficial research results to the development of industrial design automation. This research is of great significance to promote the intelligence and innovation in the field of industrial design.",

        "abstract": "In this article, the issue of human behavior learning (HBL) is addressed for a class of nonlinear human-in-the-loop (HiTL) systems where the human operator is viewed as a nonlinear optimal controller. Owing to its outstanding interpretability and strong nonlinear representation capability, the Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear HiTL control system and approximate the unknown human control law based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. A quadratic-like cost function with fuzzy weighting matrices is built to depict the human behavior, which conforms to human thinking and is unknown to the machine. The aim of the HBL is to retrieve the fuzzy weighting matrices such that the human control law will be optimal in the sense of minimizing the retrieved cost function. In the proposed HBL scheme, the state-dependent Riccati equation-based nonlinear optimal control technique plays an important role, which has a similar structure to the linear quadratic regulator theory and thus is of low computational complexity. With the help of the PDC-based fuzzy approximator for the unknown human control law, a two-step procedure is proposed for the HBL. First, a filter-based adaptive law is developed to learn the gain matrices of the fuzzy approximator using the system state data only. The convergence analysis of the adaptive estimator is also given. Then, a semidefinite programming problem with the quadratic objective function can be set up for determining the fuzzy weighting matrices of the cost function. The simulation study on a steering control system of the intelligent vehicle is given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach.",

Traditional ways of finding diseases and putting them in groups are basic, but often limited by what people think about it. They don't work well when needed for a large number of cases. This study shows a new method using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is deep learning (DL). It helps to correctly identify the degree of damage from corn rust disease. The study shows that the MLP model works well in finding and classifying disease stages using a set of 3500 and pictures from six levels. The MLP model was carefully made and taught to recognize small changes in disease levels. It puts importance on being right, exact, and remembering everything about it all the time. The machine reached 94.20% accuracy, showing it could be useful for people working with plants and those who farm. The MLP was faster, more scalable, and gave better results than other computer learning methods. It did a great job! This study aids the increasing mix of artificial intelligence and farming that's precise. It shows how DL can help solve tough agriculture problems. The results show that the MLP model can help manage crop diseases. It helps in quick and effective actions to stop these problems from causing more harm. For the future, we want to make the model stronger. We also plan on using it for other sicknesses and adding it to farming systems that check things in real-time right away. The research opens the door for better farming methods that are both green and save energy, driven by smart machines.",

First, let's talk about how quantum computers can handle big and complex data sets that are too hard for classical computers. The focus here is on the use of quantum computing methods. The main focus of our school assignment is on developing and executing quantum algorithms specifically designed to analyze and evaluate these datasets. These quantum algorithm allows us to model a complex system. Explain the basic of tool that can be used to quantum material properties. Instructions: Change the word \u2018formulas\u2019 into another Word and rephrase the sentence accordingly. The study proposes using quantum algorithms to handle large data collections. We explain how to transform classical data to quantum representation for clearer comprehension. Also illustrated is how this encoding may yield simulated outcomes. This approach ensures precise and reliable simulations. Unlike ordinary data storage and correction, quantum computing presents various problem-solving obstacles. To remove these challenges, the simulation is made painstakingly precise and dependable. Case studies may show how quantum systems can simulate complicated situations like astronomical object motions and subatomic particle activity under harsh conditions. These case studies show that quantum simulation can address issues traditional approaches can't. Our findings might affect future study, and quantum computing could transform our knowledge of complex physical events.

The proposed version combines multiple individual predictors in a manner that permits each to capture heterogeneous characteristics of the time series and think of each of the temporal and spatial dimensions within the enter statistics. An aggregation step is also included to construct cluster distributions to enhance prediction accuracy. The model's performance is evaluated on actual datasets with recognition of each temporal and spatial dimension. Results display the effectiveness of the proposed technique in predicting destiny values of time collection with accuracy higher than individual predictions. Further, the model also can cope with minor adjustments within the shape of facts, allowing for excessive flexibility within the analysis and forecasting procedure. It explores the ability of hybrid predictions of time collection in head-based total aggregation clusters. It provides a complete time collection evaluation, forecasting the usage of an aggregate of records mining and device-getting-to-know techniques. The paper introduces the vital standards and techniques for an adequate time series forecasting version. A hybrid prediction model consisting of the Autoregressive included shifting standard (ARIMA) model and the Weighted Neighbourhood common (WNA) model is then explored. The efficacy of the version is statistically tested on an artificial dataset with constant natural and seasonal time series additives and on one actual-global dataset with a vast range of correlated time collection. Compared to classic forecasting fashions, the effects demonstrate that a hybrid prediction version produces drastically higher accuracy and offers an extra sensible representation of the device's behavior. The paper evaluates hybrid prediction fashions to alternative strategies and a few viable future development directions.",

Currently, it is prevalent thinking to introduce social networks into group decision-making research, despite exhibiting promising performance, there remain significant challenges, including 1) trust risk is often overlooked, and 2) group opinions are excessively relied upon. In this regard, this article introduces the trust risk test for group consensus (SN-TRT-GC) by using probabilistic linguistic preference relations under probabilistic linguistic term sets. The proposed method ensures that the expert's competence matches the discourse as much as possible by virtue of the trust risk value. Moreover, opinion evolution relies on the dual attributes of similarity and trust, which promote the exchange of opinions among experts and greatly accelerate the consensus reaching process. Empirical investigations of satisfaction surveys demonstrate the validity and superiority of the presented SN-TRT-GC technique.",

        "abstract": "Gender bias creates inequalities in roles, expectations, and opportunities between males and females. When such biases are incorporated into artificial intelligence models, the corresponding technological solutions and products can further entrench the social biases. Herein, a new method for investigating the extent to which latent biases in text-based training data affect a language model is presented. Potential gender bias is identified by deriving values assigned to male/female words via inverse operations from embedded expressions to the original words using the approximate inverse model explanation (AIME). In particular, AIME constructs approximate generalized inverse operators for black-box models. A biased embedded representation used in machine learning models as an internal representation of word/sentence vectors likely introduces bias into the overall prediction results of such models. The OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 large language model, which provides embedded expressions, is employed to determine the gender bias included in the proposed method. Experimental results show that the OpenAI textembedding-ada-002 model is partially gender-biased owing to the training text data. These results are expected to (i) contribute to the development of effective measures preventing gender bias during the design and training of language models, (ii) promote the identification and mitigation of gender bias in future language models, and (iii) provide insights into the effect of language models and their limitations from technical, social, and cultural perspectives.",

We define the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.",

        "abstract": "In precision livestock farming, the individual identification of cattle is crucial to inform the decisions made to enhance animal welfare, health, and productivity. In literature, models exist that can read ear tags; however, they are not easily portable to real-world cattle production environments and make predictions mainly on still images. We propose a video-based cattle ear tag reading system, called ReadMyCow, which takes advantage of the temporal characteristics in videos to accurately detect, track, and read cattle ear tags at 25 FPS on edge devices. For each frame in a video, ReadMyCow functions in two steps. 1) Tag detection: a YOLOv5s Object Detection model and NVIDIA Deepstream Tracking Layer detect and track the tags present. 2) Tag reading: the novel WhenToRead module decides whether to read each tag, using a TRBA Scene Text Recognition model, or to use the reading from a previous frame. The system is implemented on an edge device, namely the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin or Xavier, making it portable to cattle production environments without external computational resources. To attain real-time speeds, ReadMyCow only reads the detected tag in the current frame if it thinks it will get a better reading when a decision metric is significantly improved in the current frame. Ideally, this means the best reading of a tag is found and stored throughout a tag\u2019s presence in the video, even when the tag becomes occluded or blurry. While testing the system at a real Midwestern dairy farm housing 9,000 cows, 96.1% of printed ear tags were accurately read by the ReadMyCow system, demonstrating its real-world commercial potential. ReadMyCow opens opportunities for informed data-driven decision-making processes on commercial cattle farms.",

A neural cluster model based on neural network was used to model the mechanism of facial emotions-induced EEG. The EEG activity induced by facial emotion and its spectral characteristics were obtained. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of emotion-driven EEG, the analysis and recognition algorithm of EEG stimulated by expression is studied by combining wavelet with ANN model. The simulation results show that the correct rate of EEG recognition based on neural network is 88.69%. The recognition accuracy of BP neural network is 76.3%, and its convergence speed is also improved. The experimental results show that this method is an effective method for EEG recognition.",

Also, using Artificial Intelligence technology, we want to create an algorithm that predicts how fake news will spread in the future. You can see various attempts at a news media platform based on Blockchain technology. However, the Blockchain news media platform is still not getting the market response we expected. It is questionable whether the reason is simply because it is a new technology, so it takes a long time to gain trust from consumers, whether consumers are not yet expecting an innovative news media platform, or whether the explosive growth of the Blockchain news media platform is difficult for other reasons. Research to answer this or direct research between Blockchain and media platforms is still lacking. In addition, the method of verifying fake news using artificial intelligence was verified, ANN, CBR, and MDA were changed, and the experiment was verified for progress. In addition, the use of 5-fold cross-validation as a comparative method was added as described above to more closely examine the possibility of its usefulness even in general situations. Also, through various fields of artificial intelligence and blockchain, verification work was done with blockchain, and fake news prediction was made using artificial intelligence. Various experiments were conducted and performance tests were performed, while the performance of about 5,000 TTPS was recorded through the third experiment. In the future, we think it is necessary to combine Artificial Intelligence and blockchain technology.",

All of this leads to significant fluctuations in college admissions, where certain schools are unable to admit a large number of students who show interest in a specific field. On the other hand, high school students lose interest in certain schools, leading to the discontinuation of specific directions essential for today's job market needs. Institutions largely fail to conduct a comparison and linkage of teaching and non-teaching activities when analyzing the talents and interests of high school students from different fields. The goal of this paper is to use programming language classifiers to predict student enrollments in colleges based on the results students demonstrate during regular attendance in high schools through participation in innovation fairs.",

Correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between students' computational thinking skills (CTS) and their five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 219 college students completed the CT Assessment Test and the Big Five Personality Inventory. The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that teachers can pay attention to the individual differences of students from the perspective of personality, and provide them with suitable education to comprehensively improve students' CTS.",

This study explores the current state of IDS in IoT. The most important points of vulnerability are identified, and we examine ways to address them immediately. One key finding of the research is that interoperability problems between differing IoT devices and platforms loom as two big roadblocks. Besides, the lack of standardized evaluation standards or sets for intrusion detection models in IoT environments turns out to be an important gap between what is being researched currently and reality. The ambiguity of how to upscale in large IoT networks is cited as an issue left unresolved by the study. In addition, it points toward the crucial role intrusion detection plays in safeguarding IoT systems and also reveals existing areas of weakness with regard to adaptability, scalability and standardization..",

        "abstract": "This study explores the full potential of burst photography, a method that captures brief moments in a flood of pictures. However, the beauty of these frames is typically obscured by undesired blemishes such as occlusions and reflections. We address these restrictions by combining deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and adaptive neural splines, which surpass traditional image fusion and reveal the hidden brilliance inside. Acting like skilled artisans, the adaptive neural splines deftly separate and reweave the image's fabric. Their subtle touch safeguards every strand of visual information, ensuring the final result is a harmonious tapestry of enhanced clarity and preserved detail. This harmonic connection reveals itself in a transforming process that combines many frames into a single, stunning tapestry. Shadows reveal their secrets, the previously opaque depths now shining with clarity. Occlusions and reflections evaporate, leaving just a spotless canvas on which the scene's genuine brightness shines. The result is a symphony of increased clarity, with minute details emerging from darkness and textures dancing with unparalleled sharpness. The power of this invention is not just theoretical. Extensive comparisons to cutting-edge approaches demonstrate its revolutionary influence. Our model outperforms others in retaining fine detail, improving overall clarity, and maintaining visual integrity. These breakthroughs not only push the frontiers of computational photography but also serve as a catalyst for future advances in image processing and analysis. This study shows that creative thinking unleashes the power of visuals. We use deep learning and adaptive splines to turn burst photographs into everlasting masterpieces that uncover hidden brilliance.",

        "abstract": "The remarkable achievements of ChatGPT and Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) have sparked a wave of interest and research in the field of large language models (LLMs) for artificial general intelligence (AGI). These models provide intelligent solutions that are closer to human thinking, enabling us to use general artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems in various applications. However, in the field of remote sensing (RS), the scientific literature on the implementation of AGI remains relatively scant. Existing AI-related research in RS focuses primarily on visual-understanding tasks while neglecting the semantic understanding of the objects and their relationships. This is where vision-LMs (VLMs) excel as they enable reasoning about images and their associated textual descriptions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying semantics. VLMs can go beyond visual recognition of RS images and can model semantic relationships as well as generate natural language descriptions of the image. This makes them better suited for tasks that require both visual and textual understanding, such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). This article provides a comprehensive review of the research on VLMs in RS, summarizing the latest progress, highlighting current challenges, and identifying potential research opportunities. Specifically, we review the application of VLMs in mainstream RS tasks, including image captioning, text-based image generation, text-based image retrieval (TBIR), VQA, scene classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. For each task, we analyze representative works and discuss research progress. Finally, we summarize the limitations of existing works and provide possible directions for future development. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress of VLMs in RS (see Figure 1), and to inspire further research in this exciting and promising field.",

        "abstract": "The solution of a typical programming task involves algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, decomposition, and abstraction skills. These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don\u2019t consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies. It was found that such feedback was very effective and improved the CT skill deficiencies of 82% of students.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that allow smart devices to communicate through various heterogeneous channels (wired or wireless). However, for conventional networks, it has become a challenging task to efficiently control and manage the data flows of a huge number of devices. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new way of thinking about networking. Because it is programmable, flexible, agile, and gives you a big picture of the network, it has tried to solve some IoT problems, like scalability, heterogeneity, and complexity. In large-scale SDN-IoT networks, there is a requirement for routing protocols that are both efficient and secure in order to ensure a superior level of quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). To address the above stated challenges, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) known as DQQS model is proposed. The aim is to achieve QoS and QoE while also ensuring the security of the SDN-IoT network. The proposed DQQS model dynamically extracts patterns from the past network history by interacting with the underlying network and generating optimized routing policies. This article employs three network metrics\u2014throughput, latency, and the probability of avoiding malicious nodes\u2014to measure the performance of DQQS. Simulations reveal that the proposed framework outperforms four state-of-the-art routing algorithms: OSPF, L-L Routing, Sailfish Routing, and RL-Routing in terms of both throughput and latency. For instance, in an attacked environment, the proposed DQQS model achieved the highest throughput value of 14.5 Mbps, surpassing OSPF at 8 Mbps, L-L at 8.2 Mbps, Sailfish at 9 Mbps, and RL at 9.5 Mbps. Similarly, this model exhibited superior performance in latency, recording the lowest latency value of 52 ms, compared to OSPF 88 ms, L-L 85 ms, Sailfish 72 ms, and RL 75 ms routing algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that this new DQQS model is a pioneering deep reinforcement learning-based technique that optimally addresses secure routing in the SDN-IoT environment, ensuring enhanced quality of service and experience, and outperforming state-of-the art DL methodologies in both security and network performance metrics.",

        "abstract": "Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a technique for continuously extracting the largest amount of energy that a source can provide under varying conditions, and it is indispensable for modern photovoltaic (PV) panels. Among several methods to achieve this, fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) have been a popular choice over the years, incorporating human-like thinking into their design to promote flexibility, robustness, and reliability. In addition, due to its high performance, low power consumption, and high circuit density, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) may be a suitable choice for implementing these controllers. This study aims to identify the applicability of FPGA-based FLCs for the MPPT of PV panels. A systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on five research questions. The methods proposed in the 14 selected studies were analyzed in terms of their advantages and limitations. Results demonstrate that FLCs are remarkably adequate for MPPT, although they are preferred when used in conjunction with other techniques. By employing FPGAs, fuzzy controllers may achieve significantly faster responses at an overall lower cost. However, this comes with increased complexity and resource usage. The findings highlight the suitability while acknowledging the limitations of FLCs and FPGAs for the MPPT in PV panels. Moreover, some aspects still require further research, such as methods for dealing with partial shading conditions, the analysis of modern techniques not yet explored in FPGAs, and the integration of FPGA-based technologies in large-scale grids.",

Autonomous learning breaks through the limitations of traditional learning models and enables learners to better utilize their fragmented time for learning.

Finally, experimental data showed that the system designed in this article had the smallest parameter size but the shortest training time, with values of only 16M and 5.649min/epoch, respectively. This indicated that the language translation system designed in this article had strong advantages, which can reduce the size of model parameters and thus reduce the training time of the model.

        "abstract": "The emerging Human-Centric Networks (HCN) paradigm shifts the passive role of individuals to an active one, intertwining the uncertainty of network resource usage with human dynamics, which are difficult to analyze and predict. This phenomenon implies an increase in reciprocal interactions between Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) and human activities, presenting the challenge of efficiently allocating network resources while taking into account qualitative human uncertainty. In this study, we propose a conceptual model that addresses and quantifies such uncertainties. The proposed model is characterized by its adaptability to various CPSS applications, facilitating its integration into existing applications and future innovations. The adaptability of the model is based on the application of the sociological concept of Boundary Objects (BO), which allows for the structuring of system components and the generation of a reference architecture that facilitates systematic problem solving. To evaluate the model, we propose a use case related to a Vehicle for Hire (VFH) application operating within a 5G network slice. The integration of the proposed model with the OMNET++ simulation framework has allowed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in intricate computational environments and have shown its capacity to incorporate previously overlooked elements that are essential for the optimal allocation of resources in CPSS. This study proposes a methodology for comprehending and mitigating the consequences of human uncertainty, emphasizing the significance of a multidisciplinary approach to resource allocation in sophisticated technological systems.",

        "abstract": "When it comes to scene classification, the lack of labelled data is a significant obstacle that forces researchers to think about innovative solutions. This work presents a revolutionary method to strengthen scene classification models by combining transfer learning with AI-generated images. A key component of this project is the construction of a carefully curated dataset of 3672 augmented AI-generated photos in a total of 6 scenes. This database not only serves as a helpful resource for additional research but also makes a substantial contribution to this area of research. Using this dataset, a VGG16 model is trained, demonstrating the usefulness of synthetic data with a notable increase in accuracy. The model's performance is further improved through subsequent training using realistic photos through transfer learning, thereby surpassing the initial baseline. This work demonstrates the transformative effect of transfer learning on scene categorization accuracy and verifies its effectiveness using synthetic data through rigorous testing and evaluation. The results open the door for AI-generated photos to be used as an effective approach to address data scarcity issues in scene classification, which will help real-world applications improve.",

Improving productivity is crucial to India\u2019s economy. Consequently, the detection of disease in greeneries plays a key role in the development sector. The accuracy and precision of diagnosing diseases in plants and animals have also been enhanced by the increased use of expertise in modern times. One solution to the problem of classifying different populations is the prospect of grouping in AI techniques. We aim to provide insight into the present state of the illnesses and how to detect them rapidly using computational reasoning. The article suggests thinking about how to use AI techniques to automatically detect plant diseases. This research paper uses the O-RPN (Optimized District Proposition Network) to isolate and control the leaves in a complicated ecosystem. The O-RPN computation incorporates the signs component using Chan-Vese (CV) techniques. The district-based CV calculation yields encouraging results for noise- and weak-edge-free image segmentation.

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of modern wireless communication, communication has become more and more convenient and widely popular. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, it is vulnerable to malicious attacks from third parties. During the establishment of UAV networks, given the limited computing power and storage resources of UAVs, traditional encryption methods may adversely affect their performance. Meanwhile, key distribution based on physical characteristics provides a new way of thinking. By utilizing the physical attributes of the channel to achieve key distribution, this method not only provides a high degree of security, but also greatly improves convenience. In addition, compared with traditional schemes, deep learning can automatically learn and integrate features at different levels, avoiding complex selection and combination of algorithms, thus possessing stronger generalization and robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of deep learning techniques to extract channel features to increase the adaptability of key distribution. This approach is expected to provide strong support for the security and reliability of UAV networks.",

        "abstract": "Contribution: This article proposes a new theoretical model with a goal to develop future human computational thinking (CT) in foundational computer science (CS) education. The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan. Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course. Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens. Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning. Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.",

This chapter looks at the origins and early development of CST. A brief account of the state of Systems Thinking (ST) in the early 1980s is necessary to discern the reasons for the emergence of the approach. The development of CST is then traced to 1991. By that time, it had become formalised around a set of three commitments, to which it has largely remained true. The first, &#x2018;systemic critique&#x2019;, insists that all systems approaches are partial, and this leads to their different strengths and weaknesses. The second, &#x2018;systemic pluralism&#x2019;, suggests that the maximum benefit can be obtained by using systems methodologies in combination during an intervention. The third, &#x2018;systemic improvement&#x2019;, explains what improvement means in systems terms and how it can be pursued. The case is then made for CST to embrace a fourth commitment, to &#x2018;systemic pragmatism&#x2019;. It is argued that this can support the other three and take CST forward.</p>",

        "abstract": "Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement.",

        "abstract": "Social media platforms are used widely by all people to express their feelings, opinions, and emotional states. Billions of people worldwide use them daily to share what they think and feel in their posts. Amongst all social media available platforms, Facebook only contains around three billion personal accounts. In this work Reddit dataset is used to automatically detect mental illness from social media posts. This study is not only limited to early detection of already existing mental illness or disorder like depression and anxiety from social posts, but also and most importantly the study is extended to predict successfully potential mental illness that would happen in future. This study deploys Nineteen different models to study the capability of them in detecting and predicting mental disorders from social media posts. Some of the deployed models are classical machine learning classifiers, some are ensemble learning models, and the rest are large language models (LLMs). Six machine learning classifiers were used in this work for the automatic detection and prediction of mental illness and logistic regression proved to be the best amongst other classifiers in this task. Nine Ensemble methods were also used and examined. Amongst the Nine ensemble learning models VC2, Light GBM, Bagging estimator, and XGBoost proved to be superior in this task. Four large language models were also used and examined for the same task. RoBERTa and OpenAI GPT proved to outperform the rest of models in this task. All those models were built, trained, tested, and compared with previous work in literature to get the best possible results. The study covers the main four mental disorders which are ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar, and Depression. The work proposed in this paper succeeded in outperforming the results in literature in terms of number of addressed mental disorders, number of models used and tested, and dataset size used to validate results. The proposed work also outperformed the only attempt in literature that addressed all mental disorders in results of detection and prediction noticeably. This work achieved the detection of already existing mental disorders F1-score of 0.80 from clinical data and of 0.52 from non-clinical data, and it achieved a prediction of future mental disorder F1-score of 0.43 from non-clinical data.",

We propose an innovative approach that combines modeling, numerical computation, and E-learning software development to enhance students' learning enthusiasm. Focusing on the teaching knowledge point of \u201cpolar moment of inertia\u201d, we examine the automotive transmission axle as a specific research case. By constructing a finite element model and conducting numerical calculations, we generated vivid visualization materials, including Mises stress and displacement cloud images. Leveraging the C# programming language, we developed E-learning software that incorporates the calculus derivation processes for axle torsion deformation. The results of our teaching experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of this teaching innovation, with a 90.63 % acceptance rate. Visualization materials, such as Mises stress cloud images, facilitate students' understanding of abstract concepts, garnering an 89.06% acceptance rate. Moreover, the E-learning software significantly increased students' learning enthusiasm, with an 85.91 % acceptance rate. The adoption of modeling and simulation to create digital materials for mechanical education provides a robust foundation for E-learning software development and classroom application.

This paper suggests the optimized approach for NST which includes a dataset selection, choosing the type model architecture, learning strategies and, all-inclusive evaluation metrics. Through meticulous experimentation, we explore four distinct dimensions of NST applications: face painting, super-slow-motion, interactive, user-customization, real-time performance along online social media. In investigating superior style transfer our product highlights the highest perceptual matching, faithful style representation, and content preservation metrics ensuring the fulfillment of artistic style without deformation of the original content. Model efficiency is achieved by introducing optimized model architectures and fast training strategies, which, in turn, provide for responsive style transfer in real time with as little latency and resource consumption as possible. This is done by adapting models within a specific artistic domain through up-tuning models which will be the source of style transfer that can be tweaked in a manner that caters for any artistic domain. Therefore, the paper research is fundamental because of the management of the user\u2019s experience by user-guided interaction, which has given interactive controls and real-time feedback that assist the users to customize stylization according to their likes and dislikes.

Soft computing is more forgiving of approximations, ambiguity, partial truth, and imprecision than hard computing. The human mind is, in a sense, the ideal model for soft computing. Techniques like fuzzy logic, machine learning, genetic algorithms, expert systems, and artificial neural networks are the foundation of soft computing. Even though soft computing theory and methods were initially presented in the 1980s, automatic control engineering currently uses them as a major area of research and study. Soft computing techniques are currently being successfully applied in a wide range of commercial, industrial, and household applications. Soft computing techniques and application areas are expected to grow further with the introduction of low-cost, outstanding-performance digital processing units and the falling cost of memory chips. The purpose of this paper is to discuss embracing uncertainties and approximation for intelligent problem-solving with the help of soft computing. First, the study has discussed various soft computing systems. Moreover, the concept of fuzzy logic has been illustrated along with a description of its applications. In terms of research methodology, this research paper has followed a qualitative research approach by gathering knowledge based on reviewing a wide range of different studies regarding the research topic. According to the findings of this research, as computer processing units get cheaper and more powerful, intelligent systems and soft computing techniques become more significant. Complex algorithms must be used by intelligent systems to make difficult judgments and select the optimal solution from a range of options.",

The framework first analyzes the implicit aspects and opinions in the text using common sense and thinking chain capabilities. Then, it reflects on the process of implicit sentiment analysis, and finally, it deduces the polarity of sentiment. The model is evaluated on the SemEval 2014 dataset, consisting of 1120 restaurant reviews and 638 laptop reviews. The experimental results demonstrate that the utilization of the ERNIE-Bot-4+SAoT model yields a notable performance improvement. Specifically, on the restaurant dataset, the F1 score reaches 75.27, accompanied by an ISA score of 66.29. Similarly, on the computer dataset, the F1 score achieves 76.50, while the ISA score amounts to 73.46. Comparatively, the ERNIE- Bot-4+SAoT model surpasses the BERTAsp +SCAPT baseline by an average margin of 47.99%.",

Most of the existing clothing design software is a subsystem of clothing CAD system, and its design method is mainly to use the mouse to replace the paintbrush or to use graphics processing software to process clothing photos, which lacks professional advantages and poor practicability. At present, in view of the disadvantages of most fashion design softwares, which focus on simple list of styles and interactive drawing functions, we put forward a digital fashion design system. The garment style can be automatically generated according to the user's requirements for garment style, material and color, and can be adjusted for style change, part increase or decrease, movement and part size modification. At present, the digitization of the garment field has participated in the whole process of garment industry production: anthropometry, garment fashion trend prediction, style design, model design, push version, code release, garment production, production management, process management, e-commerce, garment marketing, customer information management, etc.",

        "abstract": "Accurate carbon price prediction can help save energy and reduce emissions worldwide. Thus, this paper proposes a model that combines swarm intelligence algorithms with deep learning to predict carbon prices. In this model, we collect news related to carbon trading, construct a dictionary of carbon financial sentiment, and determine the emotional value of the carbon news. Secondly, The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is improved by updating the escape energy and introducing the inertia weight. Then, the LSTM is optimized using the improved Harris Hawks Optimization (IHHO) algorithm. Finally, technical and emotional data on carbon price as multiple source input values are integrated, and the MS-IHHO-LSTM prediction model is established. The results show that the MAPE of IHHO-LSTM is 1.89%, 30.48%, and 10.30% better than that of HHO-LSTM in Hubei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen Carbon Exchanges, respectively. Similarly, MS-IHHO-LSTM showed a lower MAPE than IHHO-LSTM by 27.79%, 29.82%, and 6.33% in the corresponding regions. The results of the experiment indicate that: 1) Using IHHO to optimize LSTM hyperparameters can avoid falling into local optimal and improve prediction accuracy; 2) Incorporating emotional values can further enhance the model\u2019s performance. The MS-IHHO-LSTM prediction model facilitates low-carbon investment, technological innovation, and green production, enabling enterprises to support environmental sustainability.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neuro-development behavioural disorder that is classified as a chronic disability leaving individuals unable to accurately grasp their environment and can lead to limited development of communication skills, thinking and other social skills. Prediction of ASD using video recordings is an open-ended critical problem in machine learning to facilitate the process of early intervention which requires high computational resources. This research aims to predict ASD in children using videos by extracting features and converting them into a binary classification problem thereby eliminating the need for high computational resources. This research postulates a study of machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Neural Networks in comparison for the prediction of ASD as well as a novel approach to reduce the computational requirements for the analysis of videos. This research also addresses the lack of publically available video datasets for the analysis of Autism. The highest accuracy metric for the models was using the Neural Network architecture closely followed by the Decision Tree Classifier which yielded accuracies of 99.8% and 99.65% respectively. In this article, we offer an overview of predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder whilst focusing on the importance of video datasets.",

        "abstract": "Sri Lanka has taken the initiative through its new education reforms to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a compulsory content in the ICT curriculum of lower secondary education from 2025. This national task focused on applying a more appropriate pedagogical approach to make a relatively complex subject like AI easier for students to understand. When the literature is examined, it is seen that different teaching approaches were used to teach AI worldwide, and authentic learning has been considered the most appropriate method. This study was conducted to assess the applicability of the learning module, which has been developed based on authentic learning techniques to teach AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka. A qualitative study was conducted among six ICT school teachers who engage in teaching for lower secondary grades. Participants were selected purposefully to gather more important views on the research question. Key informants\u2019 interviews were conducted using a qualitative guide, and all interviews were audio recorded following informed consent. All recordings were reviewed, and important areas were identified. Results revealed that our module provides more opportunities for the students to learn AI with their real-life experiences, moves students from passive receivers of information to active participants in their own discovery process, increases their motivation and retention to learn AI and helps to improve 21stcentury skills, i.e., learning skills, literacy skills and life skills, of the learners. The analysis of the results provided strong evidence to conclude that the developed learning module will be useful in teaching AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka using an authentic learning approach. Similarly, it will enhance the knowledge and skills of students related to AI in a more sustainable manner to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and the 4th industrial revolution.",

        "abstract": "School graduates of technology profiles classes are often seen as the most prepared potential applicants for engineering universities. Future engineers will need to apply modeling to solve problems that emerge in professional activities building on the school primary engineering learning. The construction of physical processes 3D models in computer environments can aid in the development of engineering thinking and digital training. This requires the electronic educational resources design and the development of suitable methods. The collaboration between pedagogical and engineering universities can facilitate the accomplishment of these tasks provided with methodical basis and a consolidation of the universities scientific and practical developments in the network interaction. One of the popular areas for training future engineers is distance project design where tasks are distributed among several performers. The issue of interdisciplinary design of electronic educational resources to ensure the quality of engineering training in technological profiles in schools is significant for the theory and practice of innovation in engineering education, pedagogical methodology and technology, and digital didactics. The proposed methods include computer modeling of physical processes in engineering (using materials science example), pedagogical design, and educational outcomes analysis. The paper describes the results of experimental work on organizing interdisciplinary projects for the development of electronic educational resources for school engineering learning by student teams. These teams consist of pedagogical university students, future teachers, and polytechnic university students, future engineers. It concludes that interdisciplinary training of students from pedagogical and engineering universities in the electronic educational resources design on computer modeling for school primary engineering learning is effectively feasible using distributed educational technologies. The outcome may be useful for early schoolchildren involvement in innovative engineering initiatives through participation in research projects and STEM Olympiads including multi-language educational events.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) which is neurological and developmental condition. ASD can be detected by observing distinct patterns in an individual's learning, behaviour, communication, decision making ability and social interactions. The ability to anticipate emotions can prove beneficial in various situations, particularly when dealing with individuals across the autism spectrum with varying degrees of severity. Decision- making encompasses not only intelligence and perception but also emotions. Emotion Detection is helpful in Bio Feedback Therapy for ASD. Positive emotions, for example mostly tend to facilitate forward-thinking and successful decision-making while negative emotions often contribute to poor well-being or depression. A transformer model, a type of neural network architecture, possesses the capability to automatically convert one form of input into another form of output. This work intends to investigate various signals that may be useful in identifying emotions for the purpose of predicting autism as well as transformer model-based algorithms that may be useful in determining the Autism Severity Grading. Similar methods are used now to assist those who are autistic. There is also discussion of medical applications using minimal parameters and methods.",

In this paper, two necessary approaches are addressed for the implementation of a closed-loop control system. The first approach (programming) is directly related to the software implementation and the second approach addresses the hardware instrumentation part. Both approaches are developed in a practical teaching case, from a STEM Maker workshop which consisted of 15 sessions with duration 2 hours each one. Each session consisted of 4 stages: Stage 1 (Theoretical concepts), Stage 2 (Practical Example), Stage 3 (Practice) and Stage 4 (challenge). Through these four stages, the development of skills of the attendees in the areas of programming and electronics was encouraged, applying the STEM Maker strategy. From some evaluation instruments, data was collected about the development of skills of the assistants in the implementation of software and hardware instrumentation, acquired in the STEM Maker workshop. The results indicated that approximately 70% of the workshop attendees developed the necessary skills to propose solutions to problems in their current context where the application of programming and/or electronics intervenes. The product obtained from the practice is described as a temperature control which integrates a feedback signal, this system has a wide field of applications which allowed the students of the STEM Maker workshop to achieve a project related to the individual context of each one.",

Several tools have been reported in the literature to support the development of computational thinking. This paper reports a Systematic Literature Review to present the characteristics that have made successful web systems that support the development of computational thinking in recent years and the reported limitations. Eighteen primary studies were selected where the strategies used are usually learning through lessons, practicing with exercises, working through games, and using feedback. The systems found have been used at different elementary, middle, high school, and bachelor's degree levels. Finally, the main limitations reported in using these systems were mainly the difficulty of the topics, the previous knowledge that the students should have, the attitude that the students showed and the lack of motivation. Finally, we make some recommendations to software engineering curriculum planners and programming teachers about systems for developing computational thinking.",

        "abstract": "Cloud adoption in industrial sectors, such as process, manufacturing, health care, and finance, is steadily rising, but as it grows, the risk of targeted cyberattacks has increased. Hence, effectively defending against such attacks necessitates skilled cybersecurity professionals. Traditional human-based cyber-physical education is resource intensive and faces challenges in keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies. This research focuses on the main advantages of incorporating large language models into cyber-physical education. The ChatGPT platform serves as an online tool to educate students on fundamentals, cyberattacks, and defense concepts, fostering the development of a new generation cybersecurity experts. The proposed learning approach adheres to the ChatGPT-assisted learn\u2013apply\u2013create model. Responding to prompts provided by the learners, the learning phase engages in conceptual learning, the applying phase involves mathematical modeling of various cyberattacks, and the creating phase develops MATLAB program to incorporate attacks into sensor measurements for the experiment and entails developing the necessary attack detection approaches. The effectiveness of the detection method developed by ChatGPT is assessed in both the simulation and real-time scenarios using a J-type thermocouple. The impact of the proposed learning platform over traditional learning methods is evaluated through an extensive comparative feedback analysis on the learner's foundational concepts, computational thinking, programming efficacy, and motivation. The study proved that integrating ChatGPT into engineering education enables students to swiftly learn cyber-physical fundamentals, comprehend and model cyberattacks, create new attack signatures, and contribute to developing detection algorithms. Such integration provides the learners with essential industrial skills crucial in modern industries.",

        "abstract": "Neural networks (NN) and machine learning (ML) techniques are gradually replacing true critical thinking. These methods surpass logical and quantitative approaches because they can handle massive boundaries in massive amounts of data and dynamic behavior over time. This article lays the groundwork for adaptive traffic control by proposing ML and DL calculations for crossing point traffic flow prediction. Adaptable traffic control can be accomplished by adjusting traffic light timing based on expected flow or by controlling traffic lights partially. That is why traffic flow prediction is the only focus here. The suggested ML and DL models are created, approved, and tested using two publicly available datasets. The first one gives a total of all cars analyzed by various sensors over a 56-day period, including clocks placed at six different crossroads. The ML and DL models used in this study were developed using four out of the six crossings. Subsequently, Multi-facet Perceptron Brain Organizations (MLP-NN) dealt with Irregular Backwoods, Direct Relapse, and Stochastic Inclination; MLP-NN required less preparation time but produced better results (R-Squared and EV score of 1.93) than Intermittent Brain Organizations (RNNs), which produced excellent measurement results but required more time overall. All ML and DL computations have excellent execution results, which makes them a good fit for intelligent traffic light management.",

        "abstract": "The use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, WeChat, and others have grown exponentially over time with the growth of the Internet and has become the most influential networking platforms in the 21st century. They are well-known for their low-cost, quick, and effective communication. However, the enhancement of social connectivity often creates negative impacts on society that contributes to online abuse, harassment, cyberbullying, cyber flashing, cybercrime, and online trolling. In this paper, we are focusing on cyber-flashing, the unsolicited sending of nude or sexual images, which is a common practice but often met with negative reactions from receivers. During and after COVID lockdown, cyber-flashing has been a serious threat on WhatsApp recently. The majority of study, meanwhile, has focused on identifying instances of cyberbullying rather than the effects of cyber-flashing. Cyber-flashing is the act of sending an inappropriate photo or video to another person, as well as exposing oneself to another via live video. An essential step in the detection of cyber-flashing is evaluating the level of risk in terms of abusiveness in the provided picture, or video. Therefore, the goal of this research is to create and refine a method that can effectively identify abusive cyber-flashing content and prevent inappropriate content sharing within the social media platforms or public Wi-Fi network. As a result, we have proposed a unique technique, where we employ a multi- stage model for identifying cyber-flashing photos and the proposed YOLOv3-YCbCr performs best in terms of metrics, with 98.14% accuracy, 95.58% specificity, and 97.27% sensitivity. First, the YOLOv3 technique is used to detect human presence in the image. Then, the YCbCr model is used for the skin detection and analysis. In the context of intelligent systems, skin detection is a difficult topic that has drawn a lot of attention from specialists and experts from the research community; the lack of uniform testing methodologies and standard benchmarks have made it difficult to compare different approaches fairly. Based on our studies, YOLOv3-YCbCr performs far better for skin segmentation than any prior hand-crafted approach method.",

This study explores the utilization of factor graphs in modeling the autonomous racecar planning problem, presenting an alternate perspective to the traditional optimizationbased formulation. We model the planning problem as a probabilistic inference over a factor graph, with factor nodes capturing the joint distribution of motion objectives. By leveraging the duality between optimization and inference, a fast solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the factor graph is obtained via least-squares optimization. The localized design thinking inherent in this formulation ensures that motion objectives depend on a small subset of variables. We exploit the locality feature of the factor graph structure to integrate the minimum curvature path and local planning computations into a unified algorithm. This diverges from the conventional separation of global and local planning modules, where curvature minimization occurs at the global level. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance for cumulative curvature and average speed across the racetrack. Furthermore, the results highlight the computational efficiency of our approach. While acknowledging the structural design advantages and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology, we also address its limitations and outline potential directions for future research.",

Next, the user can initiate the process of neural style transfer by clicking on the style transfer button. The computational process of style transfer is managed by a backend system that utilizes Celery, a distributed task queue, and Redis, an in-memory data structure store. This architectural design allows for effective asynchronous execution of style transfer activities, assuring the ability to handle large workloads while maintaining scalability and responsiveness. Our NST application combines advanced deep learning algorithms with modern web development technology to make artistic creativity accessible to everyone. Users may effortlessly produce compelling visual compositions with just a few clicks. Our website provides a smooth and entertaining experience for both beginners and expert users, whether they want to turn regular photos into works of art resembling famous styles or explore innovative combinations.

        "abstract": "IoT devices have changed into one of the mainstays in areas like houses, industry and education, resulting in a level of convenience and efficiency that has never been achieved before. Even though the most important advantage of the distributed network is raising the level of security, the problem of security vulnerabilities with the extended networks remains. This paper is devoted to a novel strategy of Federated Learning (FL) that could become an applied solution for enhancing the safety of the IoT. Therefore, based on its decentralized knowledge process, FL allows IoT devices to cooperate in achieving common purposes without endangering data pri vacy. The paper uses this thinking method to deal with scalability, model personalization, and non-IID data that aren\u2019t IID distributing, suggesting solutions through model aggregation techniques or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Experimental evidence highlights that FL is very useful in enhancing IoT security irrespective of the diversity of its applications. To this end, residents of smart homes experienced a 17% increase in detecting the anomalies through the setting up of FL. This situation was replicated in the industrial Internet of Things, where the false positive rates were reduced from 20% to 5%, thus improving the system\u2019s efficiency. Furthermore, in the FL context in healthcare IoT ecosystems, this blazes a trail for privacy-preserving data analytics, preserving patient confidentiality and systematic profiling of noteworthy health trends. These findings thus demonstrate that FL is a feasible way of dealing with the security challenges of IoT scalable, promptly and in a manner that maintains user privacy. The article takes part in a conversation about ways to strengthen the security of IoT networks. Such a framework is based on the computational power of IoT devices. It allows us to detect and prevent threats in time. Nonetheless, it urges extensive R&D attempts to be introduced to develop better security solutions in IoT. Without the involvement of different technologies, it won\u2019t be easy to ensure safety and create some reliable IoT ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of contemporary education, the evolution of teaching strategies such as blended learning and flipped classrooms has highlighted the need for efficient and effective generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address this, we introduce MCQGen, a novel generative artificial intelligence framework designed for the automated creation of MCQs. MCQGen uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation and advanced prompt engineering techniques, drawing from an extensive external knowledge base. This integration significantly enhances the ability of the LLM to produce educationally relevant questions that align with both the goals of educators and the diverse learning needs of students. The framework employs innovative prompt engineering, combining chain-of-thought and self-refine prompting techniques, to enhance the performance of the LLM. This process leads to the generation of questions that are not only contextually relevant and challenging but also reflective of common student misconceptions, contributing effectively to personalized learning experiences and enhancing student engagement and understanding. Our extensive evaluations showcase the effectiveness of MCQGen in producing high-quality MCQs for various educational needs and learning styles. The framework demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce the time and expertise required for MCQ creation, marking its practical utility in modern education. In essence, MCQGen offers an innovative and robust solution for the automated generation of MCQs, enhancing personalized learning in the digital era.",

        "abstract": "A Virtual Reality (VR) ambiance can simulate real-world scenarios and problems, allowing students to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical situations. The design of the VR ambiance should align with the learning objectives and provide relevant challenges and tasks that require students to use their computer technology skills to solve problems. A well-designed VR ambiance can encourage exploration and creativity in computer technology students. By providing a virtual space that allows experimentation and innovation, students can explore different approaches, test ideas, and think creatively when solving problems. This paper studies how students and professors evaluated the development of competencies during an extracurricular project for the development of a virtual interactive environment for learning a process. Designing an interactive virtual environment will require the implementation of various interactive elements, such as 3D objects, user interfaces, and animations. Students can apply their programming skills to create the necessary functionality in the virtual environment. To create an attractive and easy-to-use virtual environment, students will need to consider UX design principles. In this case, the competencies to be measured were: Solving problems generating efficient computational algorithms under models and tools of computer science and developing software applying process and quality standards of Software Engineering. To assess compliance with the development of competencies, it was decided to develop an interactive virtual environment; this is a process that involves several stages, from conceptualization to implementation and testing. The objectives of the virtual environment were established. In this case, it was decided to develop an environment that would help the user learn how to change a flat tire. A plan was created detailing how users will interact with the virtual environment. Early results show that more than 50% of the students outstandingly developed problem-solving competence, additionally, if we add the students who obtained a solid evaluation, the percentage of students who developed the competence in a more than acceptable way would go up to 93%. These results, also show that more than 70% of the students outstandingly developed software development competence. In addition, if we add the students who obtained a solid evaluation, the percentage of students who developed competence in a more than acceptable way would rise to 92%.",

This paper therefore presents the development and evaluation of a teaching unit called \u201cCup Song Encoding\u201d designed to model information encoding using a percussion song as an example. It simultaneously imparts coding theory concepts and fosters Computational Thinking of students. The material of the teaching unit is available online. The teaching unit was successfully tested with over 200 students in different age groups in K-12 during which the students' solutions were recorded and examined. The outcomes of the unit demonstrate the potential for encoding modeling to be a valuable addition to K-12 computer science education.

        "abstract": "In the digital age, programming education has become increasingly important, even in primary schools. However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. This is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in Mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. Interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in Chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, educational research has emphasized the significance of computational thinking (CT) and mathematics knowledge acquisition for students' learning in engineering subjects. Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field.",

        "abstract": "New (interdisciplinary) Computer Science (CS) subjects in K-12 education have been introduced in recent years. Most of them have educational plans derived from CS Frame-works such as the K-12 CS Framework. To some extent the educational plans have the same core topic areas: data and coding (including data compression and data structures), algorithms (in-volving variables and software projects), computers and networks (covering topics like logic tables and data transmission) and information society and data security (consisting of collection and processing of personal data and asymmetric encryption). Various Computer Science assessment tests such as the SCS1, MG-CSCI, PSIv1 and the Fairy Assessment have been developed for different age groups. These tests mostly include computational thinking, programming or topics that could be categorized in the first two core topic areas data and coding and algorithms. Hence, the research desideratum was to develop a test specifically for measuring the four core topic areas. These core topic areas are part of the educational plan of the new interdisciplinary subject IMP (Informatics, Mathematics, Physics) for secondary schools in Germany. The test was piloted with 156 (m = 117, f = 37, o = 2) 10th grade students, approximately aged 16 at the end of the lower secondary level. We used the Item-Response-Theory (IRT) to validate the test. This work in progress paper presents translated items and the psychometric evaluation of the piloted test. The contribution for both researchers and educators in the CS education research field is the set of items of the research-based CS test in the four core topic areas for 10th grade students that includes item sets for the areas computers and networks and information society and data security.",

        "abstract": "Sorting is an algorithmic concept that is covered in every fundamental computer science and engineering course and included in most if not all programming competitions. It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges. Most notably, they were able to comprehend the concepts of sorting algorithms and the computational steps behind them, and gain a better understanding of computational thinking.",

Recognizing this imperative, engineering curricula are increasingly incorporating a competency-based approach that reflects the complexities of the real world, for lifelong learning, using enabling and disruptive technologies such as humanoid robotics. We present a case study from the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus, where NAO robots are used in social projects with immediate impact in the fields of health and education, addressing sustainable development objectives. This research shows projects that have had a significant social impact in different communities in Mexico, in the areas of education and health with innovative solutions that motivate and engage the attention of the audience. A group of students from different engineering careers design, develop and implement application scenarios for the accompaniment and social appropriation of challenges such as: the incorporation of girls in STEM areas, support for groups with intellectual disabilities, dissemination and knowledge of sign language and dissemination of the cultural heritage of Xochimilco as a cultural heritage of humanity. Preliminary results indicate that this pedagogical approach not only inculcates students with essential skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork, but also makes them more aware of the social implications of their engineering studies. Evidence and results of the involvement of undergraduate students in social scenarios are shown, showing that, by integrating these elements, engineering programs aspire to train professionals capable of harnessing their technical knowledge for the general good of society as well as the perception of the participants and audiences reached.",

        "abstract": "The CDIO Framework within engineering education is based on the idea that graduates should be capable of conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating (i.e., CDIO) complex systems within a team-based learning environment. As an approach to engineering education, it aims to create an active, experiential learning setting where product and process are considered fundamental to the curriculum. Modern pedagogical strategies and innovative teaching methods allow for the implementation of the CDIO approach, where students are supported to develop deep knowledge, manage the process of designing and exploiting new items and systems, and evaluate the impact of the scientific-technological process on society. This article will highlight aspects of this approach in the development of a practical quantum electronics session. In particular, it will focus on the developed principles of an innovative practice-targeted programme that can support the development of students' engineering thinking through the linkage of education and professional activities. As graduates, the students will need to be able to create innovative engineering systems as well as integrate their understanding of natural and technological sciences to generate novel concepts. They will also need to be proficient in professional ethics and have knowledge of business and entrepreneurship fundamentals. As such, this indicates the need for a strategically-focused curriculum that supports the development of a range of transversal skills required for industry. In this paper, the CDIO model is detailed as a means of transforming engineering education on a large scale. In order to develop the fundamental framework of creative awareness sessions for quantum technologies and their applications, this study attempted to further explore and provide more specific illustrations of the concepts relating to CIDO and to consider how they may be applied within an engineering context. The current work will present and evaluate the principles of an innovative teaching technique aimed at providing students with the opportunities to understand pioneering technologies for future applications.",

        "abstract": "Computational Thinking (CT) is vital in today's digital era, especially in Engineering Education. While no official policy or teaching framework on CT education has been established in the Netherlands, a Western European country, there have been various initiatives for the integration of CT into the curriculum. Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in CT integration, we surveyed the perceptions and intentions of teachers in tertiary education in the Netherlands. Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities. To foster the integration of CT in tertiary education, our findings suggest the need for further development of higher education teacher training programs focused on CT and its relation to CS. Additionally, there is a call for further exploration of how to enhance teachers' performance expectancy and effort expectancy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a case study that explores the successful integration of project-based learning (PBL) in two courses, Biometry and Computer Vision, at the University of -DFBR-. The study emphasizes the positive impact of PBL not only on academic performance but also on student well-being, motivation, and self-regulated learning skills. In both courses, PBL was employed as a powerful tool to actively engage students in their learning process and enhance their understanding of complex subjects. The project developed by the students served as a vehicle to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, ensuring the comprehensive coverage of the course topics. The outcome of this study revealed a positive impact of PBL methodology on student performance, which was indicated by their final grades and active participation during synchronous moments throughout the course duration. Moreover, the implementation of PBL has fostered a positive and motivating learning environment, as students embrace the opportunity to work on authentic, hands-on projects. The enhancement of self-regulated learning skills, including goal setting, time management, and re-flection, further contributes to students' overall academic growth. Furthermore, the transversal skills acquired by students in the PBL environment are relevant. Collaborative problem-solving, effective communication, critical thinking, and adaptability are just a few of the key skills that students develop through their active engagement in projects. This paper offers an exploration of the successful integration of PBL in engineering education. The study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of PBL, not only in the referred courses but as a model for innovative engineering education practices. The experience at the University of -DFBR- illustrates how PBL can nurture a new generation of competent, motivated, and adaptable engineers, ready to tackle the challenges of an ever-changing world.",

It is of utmost importance to provide the students with comprehensive training and improve their competitiveness in their professional field by enhancing the skills of future generations to develop both the transversal and disciplinary competencies required that will allow them to become professionals who face challenges and opportunities in their future lives. Disciplinary competencies are the minimum necessary set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in their disciplinary field for students to perform successfully in different contexts. Traditionally, the evaluation of knowledge is used to evaluate the student's competencies in a course, and it does not usually reflect the degree of achievement of the student's competencies since these evaluations are based on specific topics and not on the acquisition of the competencies that the course should generate. The objective of this study is to design the evaluation criteria for the disciplinary competencies of Computer Science in students, as well as to measure their impact concerning the different subjects of their academic plan.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade, educational reforms introduced technologies and digital tools to a higher degree, serving as powerful catalysts in educational innovation for creating, managing, and delivering content in STEM education with a focus on computational and engineering subjects. However, in the small reality of the classroom, some discrepancies arise between policy objectives and everyday practice. The research community emphasises the importance of providing technology infusions based on educators' pedagogical beliefs as well as needs rooted in the authentic scholarly environment. Considering this perspective when orchestrating in-classroom technology can support educators in their daily experiences and enhance their digital competencies. To contribute to this aim, we propose a case study carried out via interviews with fellow primary and secondary teachers, tackling challenges in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including Computer Science (CS) and Computational thinking (CT) education delivery. Along with the teachers' perspectives, our study aims to obtain a detailed account of the classroom's internal dynamics as perceived by the teachers. The most prominent findings concern the disparity among educators' proficiency in technology endorsement, impacting the consistency in content delivery, the complexity of the assessment of students' learning process if it is digital-based, and the inclusivity and trustworthiness of online content. Finally, we suggest guidance for a further mindful in-school uptake of technology to support teachers in orchestrating content delivery with educational technologies and enhance their confidence in this aspect.",

        "abstract": "This work aims to explore the application of the physical and digital twin pair as a computational thinking instrument to support learning and exercise proportional reasoning at the ages at which pursuing STEM studies is decided. Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8\u20139 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8\u20139 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.",

In particular, AGI ventures into human-level cognition, and expands to thinking, reasoning, and awareness. This imminent evolution is envisioned to be manifested through the embodiment of AI machines, allowing machines to transcend their purely computational nature and interact with the world through the different senses. Accordingly, AI agents will be grounded in the physical environment, going through subjective experiences and acquiring the needed knowledge that will lead to understanding and cognition. In our article, we explore the path toward realizing the true vision of AGI through AI embodiment, where we dig into the different types of thinking required to achieve knowledge, and hence, cognition and understanding. Furthermore, we look through the evolution of generative AI models, and shed light on the limitations of auto-regression in large language models (LLMs), with the aim to answer the question: is sensory grounding (through 6G) necessary, and enough, to achieve understanding in LLMs? Finally, we identify the main pillars of AGI and unveil how 6G networks will orchestrate the development of AGI systems.",

The research framework focused on two phases of car body design process, that of design ideation and evaluation. In the ideation stage, we trained an imperfect Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) model that just could generate blur automobile images as the blur design motherboards for the iterative sketching, which had design uncertainties and blanks, thus activating designers\u2019 subjective initiative and aesthetic intuition to provide more creative deepen sketches. We leveraged motherboards to address uncertainty through sketching and aesthetic intuition, refining options and ultimately selecting an optimal design. In the evaluation phase, we initially constructed a parametric 3D model with 20 parameters based on the optimal design, and invited 32 designers conducting participatory design experiments, getting 1024 human-designed schemes. Following this, we administered an online survey to assess the aesthetic qualities of a total of 1024 design schemes. Leveraging the collected score data (The first round of surveys engaged 279 participants, while the second round involved 73 participants), we trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to serve as an aesthetic evaluation score predictor for unknown parameter configurations. The machine could evaluate designs autonomously, thus selecting best design from 20,000 schemes generated randomly by machine. We utilized the parametric design converting sketching images to the numeric parameters, switching the qualitative ideation to the quantitative evaluation, thus achieving aesthetic evaluation and optimization. This study explores the relationship between human cognitive intuition and machine intelligence and how they can collaborate with each other.",

In this study, we discovered this new approach to classify a person's current mental state through convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on the analysis of eye, mouth and hand positions. We use extensive data to train and evaluate our model, which includes video recordings and images that record various human activities and emotions. Pre-processing techniques including normalization and scaling are used to improve model reliability. We use a CNN architecture that is optimized for feature extraction from facial and hand movements and uses both spatial and temporal information from the input data. By extracting the main features of the eyes, mouth and hand positions and movements, we try to capture subtle clues that indicate different emotional states such as happiness, sadness etc., as well as cognitive processes such as thinking, imagining and creating. Experimental results show promising classification accuracy for detecting different mental states, with better performance than basic methods. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between body language and mental states, contributing to the understanding of human behaviour. The proposed method has significant potential for real-world applications, including Psychological and behaviour analysis, mental health assessment, personal user interfaces etc. This proposed model is simply an artificial intelligence based psychologist.",

However, abstract reasoning remains a challenge for these models, \u201cCan AI really thinking like a human?\u201d still be a question yet to be answered. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) is a metric designed to assess human reasoning capabilities. It presents a series of eight images as a problem set, where the participant should try to discover the underlying rules among these images and select the most appropriate image from eight possible options that best completes the sequence. This task always be used to test human reasoning abilities and IQ. Zhang et al proposed a dataset called RAVEN [12] which can be used to test Machine Learning model abstract reasoning ability. In this paper, we purposed Vision Transformer Contrastive Network which build on previous work with the Contrastive Perceptual Inference network (CoPiNet), which set a new benchmark for permutation-invariant models Raven's Progressive Matrices by incorporating \u201ccontrast effects\u201d from psychology, cognition, and education, and extends this foundation by leveraging the cutting-edge Vision Transformer architecture.

        "abstract": "Math Word Problem, abbreviated as MWP, constitute a class of elementary mathematical application scenarios, commonly encountered within primary secondary educational curricula. Such problems are characterized by their presentation in natural language, eschewing the utilization of intricate mathematical symbols or formulas. The focal task of model geared towards addressing Math Word Problem is twofold: first, to discern and interpret the mathematical concepts encapsulated within the textual descriptions provided, and second, to formulate an appropriate mathematical expression or equation reflective of the problem's essence. Subsequently, these models proceed to compute the solution corresponding to the derived expression, thereby completing the problem-solving process. Currently, advancements in this domain primarily revolve around improvements to encoders and decoders within models, with a relatively narrow scope of thinking processes during model solving. Consequently, the efficacy of expression solving for complex semantic Math Word Problem remains to be enhanced. In contrast to the prevalent sequence-to-tree approach, humans often employ a top-down thinking process to solve Math Word Problem. We introduce a Math Word Problem solving model featuring a dual-thinking structure, comprising a top-down solver, a step-by-step anthropomorphic thinking solver, and a consistent comparison learning module. By aligning expressions derived from two distinct solvers at multiple granularities to maintain consistency, we aim to enhance reasoning correctness. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, particularly in achieving notable improvements in solving accuracy for complex problems.",

If we observe the past few years, we see that there is a decline in the handloom export and an increase in the workforce attrition in this sector. There are multiple reasons for this shift in the workforce from handloom sector to other sectors which are more promising in terms of better pay and relatively less manual labour. This paper tries to propose a new business model that is backed up by artificial intelligence and machine language algorithms that will help and enable to create a centralized platform for the weavers that can give them the direct access to the market insights, customer preferences, latest trends, customer feedback, and much more. The objective of this paper is to reduce the burden from the weaver who other-wise have no insights on the market demand or customer preferences, which creates a demand supply gap and discourages them from continuing the profession of weaving as it costs them huge in terms of investment be it money needed for the looms or the time, and energy spent behind the loom in weaving the handwoven products.",

The evaluation of mobility alternatives as design improvement strategies requires more advanced instructional techniques with new structures of complexity that can demonstrate, analyze, or compare system performances in order to achieve environmental sustainability in general and the well-being of the end-users in particular. As an emerging technology, games are capable of representing operations and management of passenger freight transportation and increase situational awareness of capacity bottlenecks. However, few research efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of the research progress. Based on the profiling methodology that has been previously employed in retrospect of healthcare simulations, this article presents a bibliometric review of games for health in transportation systems. The study carries out a literature analysis of the modelling methods to assemble gamified scenarios from a planning and managerial perspective. The Web of Science Core Collections are used to identify research items and investigate all the game-based studies in the cross-disciplinary research area of transportation and public health. The technology, game mechanism, and the health-related issue addressed are grouped into broad categories. The research findings are three-fold. (1) The majority of publications are classified into research efforts revolving around slow and road transportation modes. (2) Although scores, badges, and challenges are considered as the frequently seen gamification features, environmental simulation, avatars, and narratives appear as game mechanisms for the activation of the individual decision-making process. (3) Introducing system dynamics, human-computer interaction design, and a stakeholder accountability framework into the multi-stakeholder simulation setting leverages gaming outcomes with health benefits amid transportation system end-users. The literature study concludes with an integrated framework summarizing the best design practices between 2002 and 2022 on how the lessons learned from serious gameplay in virtual environments could translate into real mobility improvements. A selection of future research questions is curated to envisage new links between transportation and health research communities.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes models for predicting the subjective impressions of interlocutors in discussions according to multimodal nonverbal behaviors. To that end, we focus mainly on the functional aspects of head movement and facial expressions as insightful cues. For example, head movement functions include the speaker\u2019s rhythm and the listener\u2019s back channel and thinking processes, as well as their positive emotions. Facial expression functions include emotional expressions and communicative functions such as the speaker addressing the listener and the listener\u2019s affirmation. In addition, our model employs synergetic functions, which are jointly performed with head movements and facial expressions, assuming that the simultaneous appearance of head and face functions could strengthen the results or lead to multiplexing. On the basis of these nonverbal functions, we define a set of functional features, including the rate of occurrence and composition balance among different functions that emerge during conversation. Then, a feature selection scheme is used to identify the best combinations of intermodal and intramodal features. In the experiments, an SA-Off corpus of 17 groups of discussions involving 4 female participants was used, including interlocutors\u2019 self-reported scores for 16 impression items felt during the discussion, such as helpfulness and interest. The experiments confirmed that our models\u2019 predictions were significantly correlated with the self-reported scores for more than 70% of the impression items. These results indicate the effectiveness of multimodal nonverbal functional features for predicting subjective impressions.",

        "abstract": "Organized misinformation campaigns on Twitter continue to proliferate, even as the platform acknowledges such activities through its transparency center. These deceptive initiatives significantly impact vital societal issues, including climate change, thus spurring research aimed at pinpointing and intercepting these malicious actors. Present-day algorithms for detecting bots harness an array of data drawn from user profiles, tweets, and network configurations, delivering commendable outcomes. Yet, these strategies mainly concentrate on postincident identification of malevolent users, hinging on static training datasets that categorize individuals based on historical activities. Diverging from this approach, we advocate for a forward-thinking methodology, which utilizes user data to foresee and mitigate potential threats before their realization, thereby cultivating more secure, equitable, and unbiased online communities. To this end, our proposed technique forecasts malevolent activities by tracing the projected trajectories of user embeddings before any malevolent action materializes. For validation, we employed a dynamic directed multigraph paradigm to chronicle the evolving engagements between Twitter users. When juxtaposed against the identical dataset, our technique eclipses contemporary methodologies by an impressive 40.66% in F score (F1 score) in the anticipatory identification of harmful users. Furthermore, we undertook a model evaluation exercise to gauge the efficiency of distinct system elements.",

In order to overcome this problem, many studies recently have trained deep learning models with synthetic data.

In this work, we propose domain adaptation for self-supervised 6DoF pose estimation, which leverages the components and introduces an effective method to reduce domain discrepancy. First, we adopt a multi-level domain adaptation module, on image level and instance level, to learn domain-invariant features. Second, we used entropy-based alignment to minimize the entropy of representation embedding. Finally, we evaluate our approach on LineMOD and Occlusion-LineMOD datasets. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves higher performance compared to the prior methods and demonstrate effectiveness in domain shift scenarios on 6DoF pose estimation.",

This paper delves into the autonomous evolutionary process observed in humans and biological entities, asserting that \u201cNeeds are the fundamental driving force for organism evolution.\u201d Additionally, the paper introduces corresponding representation algorithms and lays out mathematical theoretical foundations, thereby furnishing a theoretical explanation and a solid mathematical basis for understanding the autonomy of general intelligence models.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance across various fields. Consequently, numerous researchers are exploring the potential of applying these models to graph problems. However, the effect of the temperature coefficient on graph reasoning within large models remains underexplored. To this end, we investigate the effect of temperature by using NLGraph as a benchmark. We aim to explore the effect of varying the temperature parameter in the discrete range of 0 to 1 on the models\u2019 inference performance. The experimental results show that the LLMs\u2019 sensitivity to temperature varies across tasks at different difficulty levels. In most cases, the accuracy is higher at moderate temperatures and lower at extreme temperature settings, suggesting that proper temperature tuning can improve inference performance. In addition, the effect of temperature change on accuracy is more significant in the shortest path problem. As the temperature increases, the tendency of the model to explore different solutions increases and the creativity and disorder of the response increases, leading to a decrease in accuracy and causing an increase in the rate of change.",

This study focuses on the development of a medical-specific question-answering model leveraging the Qwen-VL 7B model, an advanced Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM), to enhance the understanding and generation of medical texts. The Qwen-VL 7B model's capabilities in both language and visual comprehension make it an ideal candidate for medical question-answering systems, which require a deep grasp of medical knowledge and language. The research objectives include adapting the Qwen-VL 7B model to medical terminology, utilizing its visual understanding for medical imaging analysis, optimizing question-answering systems for medical scenarios, and evaluating the performance of these models. To achieve these goals, we employed methodologies such as dataset construction, model fine-tuning, and user studies. Results showed that the Qwen-VL-Mediacal model achieved a Rouge-1 score of 0.6147, indicating its potential for medical applications. However, challenges remain, such as understanding complex scenes and abstract concepts. Future research will aim to improve the model's adaptability and reasoning capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Computational Thinking (CT) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for Computer Programming. We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.",

The challenge of offering this subject through distance education adds to the complexity, given the need for students to adapt to this mode of teaching and learning, which significantly differs from traditional classroom settings. Multiple studies suggest that students must appropriately develop cognitive and non-cognitive skills for effective learning. Yet, there is a pressing need for further investigation into the impact of non-cognitive skills on student performance, with a particular focus on motivation, which plays an important role in student success. In this sense, considering the specificities of learning programming, the context of distance education, this research aims to understand the factors that can stimulate students' motivation for initial learning of programming, developing a virtual learning environment that promotes student motivation to learn to program and evaluate the environment to identify whether its features have the potential to stimulate student motivation.",

Big data, as a hot topic in current digital technology and digital development, is based on massive data and generates value through computational analysis. It has been applied in various fields and different scenarios. China has issued the \u201cOverall Layout Plan for Digital China Construction\u201d document, which clarifies the need to accelerate the construction of Digital China, promote digital technology innovation, improve the digital governance system, and enhance digital security capabilities. The digital reform and development of education is an important part of the construction of a digital China, and it is an inevitable path to achieve the modernization of China's education. The development of digital education requires innovative digital applications in teaching methods, teaching resources, teaching evaluation, educational governance, and actively promoting the application of digital technologies such as big data and cloud computing in specific educational scenarios. The performance management of university teachers, as one of the important contents of educational governance and university management, relies on big data to establish a data governance system for the performance management of university teachers, which is precisely the demand for the digital development and construction of education. This article explores the application of big data in the digital construction of performance management for university teachers from three aspects: background, definition and characteristics of big data, and digitalization of performance management for university teachers. With big data as the core and data governance as the goal, big data application design is carried out from three perspectives: improving the digital performance system for university teachers, digitizing the performance content of university teachers, and designing a big data platform for university teacher performance management.",

Disciplines within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (known as STEAM) have been particularly effective in fostering these skills. However, when considering students with disabilities, especially those with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD), this assertion often falls short. In this context, the RoboSTEAMSEN project emerges as an initiative designed to enhance educational processes by providing teachers of IDD students with the necessary resources to promote STEAM engagement. The project proposes the use of active learning methodologies and robotics to achieve this goal. The primary objective of the project is realized through several strategies: understanding the needs of students with disabilities and adapting the use of robotics and active learning methodologies accordingly; training teachers in the use of these resources; and creating a platform to exchange experiences, resources, lessons learned, tools, case scenarios, etc., while reaching other potential stakeholders such as caregivers and policymakers. The main outcomes of the project are teacher training programs and the development of associated competencies, tools to identify and classify resources for the students, and technological platforms to ensure the sustain ability of the project once it concludes.",

Consistent research indicates that students lacking early exposure tend to avoid college-level computer science courses and frequently underperform compared to peers with prior experience. In response, we've created a two-week computer science camp tailored for upper elementary and middle school students from rural and low-income backgrounds. The camp adapts computer science concepts to diverse cultures, challenges stereotypes, and showcases the diverse backgrounds of computer scientists. This paper outlines the camp's design, shares experiences from 40 participating students, and highlights engaging lessons that in-corporate technologies such as Sphero Bolt, Sphero Rover, Tello Drones, Lego Spike Prime, and Scratch. We also gather data on students' favorite activities to understand their interests. Our discussion covers effective strategies for participant recruitment, community trust-building, professional development facilitation, camp activity organization, and project promotion. By sharing challenges and lessons learned, we aim to assist fellow researchers and educators in similar initiatives, fostering collaboration and progress in the field of computer science education.",

This is particularly important since many studies simply resize the image without thinking about potential effects of image distortion on the model's segmentation performance. Since the objective of tumor segmentation is to predict the pixels that comprise the actual tumor, image cropping was performed in order to focus more on the brain and the tumor and not on the background. This conjecture was tested using state-of-the-art models namely 2D U-Net, 2D U- Net with VGG19 as backbone, 2D U-Net with InceptionV3 ad backbone, and 2D U-Net with InceptionResNetV2 as backbone. Three different configurations were designed for this purpose. The first configuration used resized images while the second configuration used cropped images. The third configuration used pretrained weights of models of trained on the resized images and then applied them on the cropped images. Overall, the top three models are 2D U-Net with InceptionResNetV2 as backbone trained using the resized images followed by 2D U-Net trained also using the resized images and then finally by 2D U-Net trained using the cropped images. As to why cropping did not perform well in this experiment, several plausible explanations were provided in this study.",

SCAPE injects randomness into generative AI, and enables memory, making use of the built-in language skills of GPT -4 to vary prompts via text-based mutation and crossover. We demonstrate that compared to DALL. E 3, SCAPE enables a 67% improvement in image novelty, plus improvements in quality and effectiveness of use; we show that in just three iterations SCAPE has a 24% image novelty increase enabling effective exploration, plus optimization of images by users.

        "abstract": "This article discusses the latest developments of the Sucre4Stem tool, as part of the Sucre initiative, which aims to promote interest in computational thinking and programming skills in K-12 students. The tool follows the Internet of Things approach and consists of two prominent components: 1) SucreCore and 2) SucreCode. SucreCore incorporates an advanced microcontroller packaged in a more compact design and enables wireless connectivity. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, supports two different sets of blocks depending on the education grade, and facilitates wireless communication with SucreCore. At the educational level, Sucre4Stem fosters new group dynamics and encourages students to experiment real-world projects by promoting the \u201cprogramming to learn\u201d approach to concepts from other disciplines as opposed to the strategy widely applied in schools of \u201clearning to program\u201d in isolation.",

In this article, the processes of control decision-making in digital control information systems were systematically analyzed and studied. During the analysis of processes control decision-making in digital control information systems, its functions and shortcomings were determined using systematic approach methods. It was the initial stage of a detailed assessment of task positions and the results of statistical models of benchmark for control decision-making were considered. A control decisionmaking rule (master plan) has been developed that allows identifying and choosing the best solutions according to the benchmark and preferences of the control decision-maker. Based on this master plan, an array the most optimal solutions are formed, ranked among the available solutions for the current position. Also, efficiency measures and benchmark are formed, which are used to evaluate the results according to the selected efficiency benchmark and determine the priority level of option solutions corresponding to these results. A model for choosing the optimal solution according to effectiveness measures and benchmark has been developed. In this article, part of the main tasks of digital control information technologies is the creation and calculation of a computer-based information system that thinks logically and intelligently, as well as devices that make human-like control decision-making under positions of unpredictability and speculative. Computational experiments were conducted to solve fuzzy model tasks of control decisionmaking in digital control information systems. Based on the results of computational experiments on task solving, it can be seen that the quality, efficiency and reliability of control decision-making made in digital control information systems are improved.",

This paper tries to outline the evolving relationship of human expression with machine intelligence\u2014in other words, it tries to answer how AI algorithms have redefined the landscape of Indonesia literature from creation to critique. This paper will discuss firstly the historical development of AI in literature from a seed idea to its present sophisticated application. It is against this background that the paper explains how this has been done through a comprehensive review of existing literature. It brings out the way AI has become a collaborator and a provocateur in the creative process by making it possible for humanity to create poetry, prose, and narrative structures. This paper will delve into a few of the most telling examples and casuistries into exactly how AI-generated literature differs\u2014from the level of its stylistic tendencies to the quantity of its thematic preoccupations. The research will also analyze the impact of AI on literature analysis and interpretation. Even canonical works were given new keys to be read with the help of advanced algorithms in text and sentiment analysis, and their light was shed on contemporary texts too. Below, the following sections, is a survey of some of the ways AI-driven methodologies have only augmented traditional literary analysis, allowing scholars to draw patterns, themes, and even nuances of language that may escape ordinary human perception.",

Wavelet coefficients are highly discriminative features that serve as condensed reconstructions of the underlying data. Uncertainty and high-dimensional data provide issues that are addressed by the combination of WT and IT2FLS. With the use of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering for unsupervised structure learning and evolutionary algorithms for supervised parameter adjustment, the IT2FLS employs a hybrid learning approach. The use of WT streamlines this computationally demanding learning process, lowering computational load and improving IT2FLS performance. Well-known medical datasets (Cleveland heart disease and Wisconsin breast cancer) from the UCI Collection for machine learning are used for experimental assessments. Computed performance measures include area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The findings demonstrate the better efficacy of the wavelet-IT2FLS methodology in comparison to other machine learning techniques, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, fuzzy ARTMAP, support vector machine, and probabilistic neural network. The suggested approach has potential to assist clinicians and medical professionals in making decisions.",

Nevertheless, resource-constrained machinery, such as low-power aerial vehicles, often lack the requisite internal computing resources to easily run cutting-edge simulations of neural networks. Cloud robotics appears as an answer, allowing robots to offload processing to centralized computers for greater precision models. Nonetheless, the ignored downside of cloud robots lies in the possible delay and data loss experienced during contact over crowded wireless networks. This study discusses the Robot Transferring responsibility Problem, exploring when and where robots should offload sense tasks that improve accuracy while reducing the costs involved with cloud communication. The method involves framing shifting as a sequence decision-making issue concerning robots and suggesting a remedy using sophisticated reinforcement learning. Through models and hardware tests employing advanced thinking DNNs, what was suggested sharing strategy improves vision task efficacy by 1.3 2.6 times as a result of standard strategies, allowing robots to increase their sense accuracy while incurring minimal communication via cloud costs.",

This paper has detailed issues on the application of AI-powered literary criticism and an overview of methodologies, applications, and implications accompanying the adoption of AI technologies. The paper starts with the context in which AI has actually emerged as one of the hot topics in literary studies, emanating from the crossroads of computational linguistics, natural language processing, and machine learning. \u201cThe true research opportunity that thus emerges from this work is the development of new AI technologies that can help supplement and augment traditional practices of literary analysis in such a way that scholars can get deeper into texts in search of the sorts of patterns and meanings that interest them. This paper presents illustrative examples and case studies in the applications of AI to literary criticism, which include sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and stylometric analysis. What these techniques afford researchers is a set of tools capable of processing large corpora of text with such accuracy and speed that identifying recurring motifs, characters dynamics, and thematic elements over genres, and literary periods is no problem. The following paper considers the ethical issues at the heart of AI-powered literary criticism, calling into question the algorithmic bias of authorship attribution and interpretive tasks it currently automates.",

        "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize various facets of human existence, its influence in creative domains, particularly literature, has increasingly come to be pronounced. The following paper will handle the ways that character development is changing in modern fiction. It investigates the ways in which AI technologies are outlining the way the creation, representation, and perception of characters in fiction are being developed. That means AI is advancing in character creation in ways that open up a whole new set of doors for writers: the use of powerful tools to generate, field, analyze, and refine their characters in ways previously unthinkable. Using the algorithms of natural language processing (NLP), these days, AI is used to help write dialogue, create characters with their traits, and sometimes even develop the entire character\u2019s arc. This union of human creativity and computational powers doesn\u2019t just make the process of writing faster but, rather, opens doors for new possibilities in innovative storytelling. AI-driven analytics help authors to pick up the insight into reader preferences and trends that tend to help them develop character traits and the storyline, most appealing to the readers. The application of machine-learning algorithms to vast repositories of literature seems to derive character dynamics and tropes that are so archetyped, but their renderings are much more nuanced and impactful. At the same time, this AI character raises very basic questions about authorship, creativity, and the nature of the story. As more and more writers adopt AI for character generation, they do raise some question about authenticity and originality.",

Our primary conclusions are that students are interested in using ChatGPT in the context of education and that there is no significant difference in the tasks they use it for depending on their academic major. Students use the tool more commonly for topics relevant for their fields and the average satisfaction with the tool grows the more frequently students use it, meaning ChatGPT, like other tools, is learnable.",

Those in the support phase are the least aware of the importance of a blame-free environment, which is a key factor for effective lean transformation. In the application phase, there is a clear lack of awareness of the Kanban system. The lack of knowledge of plant management is also consistent with the experience.

Amidst the growing interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for sensory analysis, our research distinguishes itself by employing a rigorous methodological framework. Our approach, named the \u2018Incremental Analysis of Baseline Accuracy,\u2019 identifies the chemical variables most predictive of wine quality. This framework aims to streamline the predictive process by pinpointing key variables that significantly influence quality assessments. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of a methodology that precisely determines the criticality of chemical inputs, both their exact values and their correct order, to identify which inputs significantly contribute to the quality assessment of a sensory perception, such as taste. The centerpiece of our paper is a vibrant 3D pie chart that illustrates the percentage criticality of different input variables for perceiving the quality of red wine. This chart symbolizes the essence of our paper: a \u2018pie\u2019 representing the empirical conclusion, not mere conjecture. Through this paper, we have shown that it is possible to quantify a qualitative, perceptual aspect like taste perception, which is often believed to be assessable only through subjective conjecture. Moreover, our findings, facilitated by the Incremental Analysis of the Baseline Accuracy method, demonstrate that this perception can be systematically quantified, challenging traditional assumptions about sensory analysis.",

However, since we cannot represent unitary operators in a mere analytical way on digital computers, contemporary digital implementations of quantum compiling resort to heuristic numerics and remain below the computational performance engineers hope to realize using the result of Solovay and Kitaev. This paper discusses quantum compiling within a framework of computable analysis, establishing a concept of computable unitary operators for digital computing based on the theory of Turing machines. Particularly, we prove that digital quantum compiling is uncomputable due to the underlying algebraic structure. Finally, we discuss several implications of our findings for heuristic digital implementations of quantum compiling, hinting toward possible research directions to thoroughly understand the relevant bottlenecks.",

In contrast, the evaluation of 3D images and 3D data in digital pathology has not yet reached this level. One of the reasons for this is the resolution of digitized pathological sections, as well as the computing capacity required for the 3D reconstruction model created from them. In the course of our research, we designed and developed a solution that helps overcome difficulties arising from hardware resources with a technique called real-time network video streaming. Our solution enables users to collaboratively visualize 3D medical data even on low computing capacity devices. In the paper, we describe a part of this solution, which refers to the definition of the quality of service indicator. In our research, we implemented several solutions to define quality service in order to provide the best possible result to the user. In the paper, we describe and compare these solutions.",

As a result, federated cloud infrastructure was initiated to provide more cloud computing resources to accommodate more cloud users\u2019 requests and also to provide equal requests mapping with the available cloud resources. Nevertheless, the issue of unequal allocation of requests within the datacenter(s) that makes up the federated cloud environment still persists. This research work presents an intra-datacenter load balancing algorithm in a federated cloud environment named; the intra-balancer adapted throttled algorithm to evenly distribute requests in each datacenter that formulate the federated cloud infrastructures. The simulation of the intra-balancer was carried out in CloudAnalyst, the results of the implementation showed that the intra-balancer outperformed the Round-Robin and ESCE with 98.93ms and 2.26ms for the response and processing time respectively. The results assert that the intra-balancer algorithm provides a better load balancing solution in a federated cloud environment.",

Traditional methods for network slice prediction often lack efficiency and result in inaccuracies. By leveraging ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest, an intelligent framework that automates network slice prediction is developed. This framework enhances network virtualization and management, facilitating resource allocation. The ML algorithms take real-time network conditions and usages, such as packet delay and smart city, as input and output for selecting the most suitable network slice. Data analysis is further conducted to reveal the connections between the input parameters and how these parameters influence the selection of the accurate network slice. Network slicing plays a crucial role as it enables the customization of services and facilitates efficient scaling to meet the specific needs of different applications and industries. The accuracy scores of the employed ML algorithms were generally perfect, except for the KNN and SVM classifiers, which achieved an accuracy of 94.30% and 92.16%, respectively, for the prediction of network slices based on incoming network connections and usages.",

Considering the limited capability of traditional methods in extracting and representing audio features, a multi-track music generation model based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Transformer network is proposed. This model first utilizes the BERT model to encode and represent music data, capturing semantic and emotional information within the music data. Subsequently, the encoded music features are inputted into the Transformer network to learn the temporal relationships and structural patterns among music sequences, thereby generating new multi-track music compositions. The performance of this model is evaluated, revealing that compared to other algorithms, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 95.98% in music generation prediction, with an improvement in precision by 4.77%. Particularly, the model demonstrates significant advantages in predicting pitch of music tracks. Hence, the multi-track music generation model proposed in this study exhibits excellent performance in accuracy and pitch prediction, offering valuable experimental reference for research and practice in the field of multi-track music generation.",

However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.",

        "abstract": "Securing user electronics devices has become a significant concern in the digital period, and a forward-thinking solution covers the fusion of blockchain (BC) technology and deep learning (DL) methods. Blockchain improves device safety by transforming access management, storing credentials on a tamper-resistant ledger, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and giving a robust defence against malevolent actors. Integrating DL into this framework also raises safety measures, as it permits devices to inspect and regulate to develop attacks distinctly. DL models accurately recognize intricate designs and anomalies, allowing the technique to distinguish and threaten possible attacks in real time. The fusion of BC and DL not only improves the reliability of user electronics but also establishes a dynamic and adaptive safety system, enhancing consumer confidence in the safety of their devices. Therefore, this study presents a BC-Based Access Management with DL Threat Modeling (BCAM-DLTM) technique for securing consumer electronics devices in the IoT ecosystems. The BCAM-DLTM technique mainly follows a two-phase procedure: access management and threat detection. Moreover, BC technology can be applied to the access management of consumer electronics devices. Besides, the BCAM-DLTM technique applies a deep belief networks (DBNs) model for proficiently identifying threats. To enhance the recognition results of the DBN model, the hyperparameter tuning procedure uses the reptile search algorithm (RSA). The experimental outcome study of the BCAM-DLTM approach employs the NSLKDD dataset. The comprehensive results of the BCAM-DLTM approach portrayed a superior accuracy outcome of 99.63% over existing models in terms of distinct metrics.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been employed significantly in different domains of computing education. Nevertheless, these models have been focused on essential adherence to their integration as coding assistants in computing education. However, attention has been switched to thoroughly examining and analyzing LLM behavior, particularly in computing education for programming tasks such as code generation, code explanation, and programming error message explanation. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. This article addresses this gap systematically and details how different LLM-based coding chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. To achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. These objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. These limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness. The finding also reports multiple research directions that can be considered in future research related to LLMs in computing education.",

We are pursuing a theoretical business framework to find an optimal solution for the seamless service-oriented m-commerce application performance. In this approach, we identify the components of m -commerce applications that could reduce mobility barriers and improve application execution time and device energy efficiency. This led us to propose a framework for m-commerce application performance that uses the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) solutions.

Correlation analysis was conducted to examine their relationships. We analyzed their relationships using correlation analysis and generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM). The results of the correlation analysis showed both weak positive correlations and weak negative correlations between the immersion factor and CT skills, indicating the importance of striking an appropriate balance between increasing player immersion and improving CT skills during game design. The results of generalized structural equation modeling revealed that while increased presence promoted creativity, high immersion hurt algorithmic thinking, flow state hurt problem-solving skills, and the factor of game immersion had no significant effect on cooperative skills. These findings suggest the importance of considering game design elements that target specific cognitive abilities in designing game-based health promotion and treatment programs. For example, immersive game design may effectively enhance creativity and problem-solving skills.

        "abstract": "This article explores strategies for cultivating a paradigm shift in the engineering design of intelligent machines, moving from conventional anthropocentric priorities toward a more ecocentric orientation aligned with ecological ethics. Through a comprehensive literature review, historical patterns of anthropomorphism in intelligent systems are traced, revealing how human-centered considerations have persistently dominated machine design across eras. To disrupt this enduring lineage and integrally reorient technology innovation toward ecological balance, four targeted strategies are proposed: (1) adopting question-seeking and systems thinking; (2) designing integrated ecosystems rather than discrete networks; (3) balancing exploitation with exploration; and (4) infusing diverse perspectives through transdisciplinarity. By reforming engineering education and culture from the ground up, the creation of intelligent machines can be realigned to enrich our shared environment rather than simply maximize human primacy. This paper offers a constructive roadmap to transform the promise of increasingly autonomous technologies in the $21^{\\text {st }}$ century and beyond.",

The Vertex Cover problem, a fundamental challenge in graph theory, finds significant relevance in the context of the compute continuum, where the optimal placement of application images across a diverse range of computational resources is a critical concern. Our proposed TLAV-based algorithm addresses this challenge by leveraging local information at each vertex to make intelligent decisions, thereby reducing the global complexity of the problem. While this approach could potentially lead to resource overprovisioning, we argue that in the context of the compute continuum, this trade-off can provide more flexibility and redundancy, enhancing the reliability of the system. Through extensive analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm on large-scale graphs, making a significant contribution to the field of resource management in the compute continuum.",

Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students.

The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions.

This approach allows us to creatively visualise complex data interactions in a 3D space, where the metaphorical \u2018mass\u2019 and \u2018distance\u2019 between entities dictate their spatial arrangement based on calculated \u2018gravitational\u2019 forces.

However, a critical challenge emerges - the risk of \"hallucinations,\" where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information. This paper proposes Comparative and Cross-Verification Prompting (CCVP), a novel technique specifically designed to mitigate hallucinations in educational LLMs. CCVP leverages the strengths of multiple LLMs, a Principal Language Model (PLM) and Auxiliary Language Models (ALMs), to verify the accuracy and educational relevance of the PLM's response to a prompt. Through a series of prompts and assessments, CCVP harnesses the diverse perspectives of various LLMs and incorporates human expertise for intricate cases. This method addresses the limitations of relying on a single model and fosters critical thinking skills in learners within the educational context. We detail the CCVP approach with examples specifically applicable to educational settings, such as geography. We also discuss its strengths and limitations, including computational cost, data reliance, and ethical considerations. We highlight its potential applications in educational disciplines, including fact-checking content, detecting bias, and promoting responsible LLM use. CCVP presents a promising avenue for ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLM-generated educational content. Further research and development will refine its scalability, address potential biases, and solidify its position as a vital tool for harnessing the power of LLMs while fostering responsible knowledge dissemination in education.",

        "abstract": "Constrained by the finite depth of field (DOF) in optical cameras, imaging devices face difficulties in achieving complete sharpness across all objects or areas within the same scene. Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) technology has emerged in response to this challenge. This technique combines complementary information from multiple partially focused images to generate an all-in-focus fused image. The fully clear image is the foundation of subsequent visual tasks. However, existing methods rarely focus on the fusion of image sequence, even though image sequence are more common in practical scenarios. In this paper, we have proposed a novel MFIF generative model based on transformer encoder, termed as SPAFusion. We think that MFIF should focus on patches from the same regions within the source images. Therefore, the attention mechanism of our model is based on patches. We further introduce a shift patch mechanism to integrate long-range dependencies. Benefit from the patch attention and shift patch mechanisms, our model boasts a significantly reduced parameter count and computational complexity compared to existing transformer-based MFIF models. Additionally, the introduction of the shift patch mechanism enables the model to integrate long-range dependencies, allowing it to incorporate both intra-domain and cross-domain contextual information. Finally, we employ pooling to obtain the fused image, enabling our model to support the fusion of image sequence. Experiments show the superiority of our SPAFusion compared to the state-of-the-art MFIF models.",

The one-stage object detection model directly completes object detection through a single forward propagation and has fast real-time object detection capabilities, making it widely used\u2014especially the model of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series. Improving the detection accuracy of the YOLO model has always been a research topic. The gradient architecture cascades feature information extraction and aggregates all features at the end, which can improve the feature fusion ability of the network. Combining the idea of gradient architecture, this paper proposes a YOLO based on gradient architecture: Gradient-YOLO. Specifically, this paper integrates gradient architecture into the backbone, neck, and bottleneck structures in the YOLO network, obtaining gradient backbone, gradient neck, and gradient bottleneck, respectively. By combining gradient architecture, various network parts in Gradient-YOLO can fully aggregate multi-layer features, reduce feature loss, and thus improve detection accuracy. This paper takes the mature YOLOv5 model and the latest YOLOv8 model as the baseline and combines gradient thinking to obtain Gradient-YOLOv5 and GradientYOLOv8. Moreover, conduct experimental testing on the MS COCO dataset. Regarding the mAP@.5 detection indicator, compared to YOLOv5s, Gradient-YOLOv5s increased by 5.07%. Compared to YOLOv8n, Gradient-YOLOv8n has increased by 4.63%. Therefore, the combination of gradient architecture can improve the detection accuracy of YOLO networks.",

This study introduces an innovative approach to implementing computational creativity in the scientific domain, exemplified through the automatic generation of trigonometric identities using a novel LeakGAN model, a Generative Adversarial Network with leaked information. The novelty of the proposed LeakGAN lies in its discriminator model, constructed on the foundation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), aimed at capturing the most relevant features from input data. These features are subsequently leaked to the generator model, enabling the production of identities with substantial originality and quality. The introduced novelty in the discriminator\u2019s architecture encompasses the use of a new activation function called Mish, strategically employed to enhance the network's convergence rate and address over-fitting issues during training. Additionally, an attention layer is introduced to highlight the most relevant information within the feature space, thereby improving the network's learning capacity. Furthermore, a unique mixed pooling layer is utilized, combining the advantageous effects of max-pooling and average pooling operations to enhance the network's adaptability to varying feature distributions. Performance analysis, incorporating BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metrics and various comparative studies, substantiates the efficacy of the proposed LeakGAN model in generating novel identities compared to its traditional counterparts. Moreover, human evaluation involving 20 mathematical experts confirms the significant novelty of the generated identities compared to existing standard textbook problems. Consequently, the proposed technique proves valuable for generating diverse trigonometric identities suitable for inclusion as chapter-end exercises in middle school mathematics textbooks.",

In this context, further consideration of the heterogeneous behavior of competitors and their impact on the evolution of conflicts deserves special attention. Usually, DMs' evaluation thinking has certain ambiguity and uncertainty, and they are accustomed to giving qualitative evaluation information. Given the unique advantages of trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets (TrIT2FS) in the fusion of decision domains and transformational linguistic expressions, this paper constructs a theoretical framework for a graph model on TrIT2FS and proposes a method for calculating DMs preference ranking and a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function. Firstly, the DMs will consider multiple factors in the decision evaluation process, and there are specific regret avoidance psychological behavior characteristics; thus, this paper integrates VIKOR and regret theory to solve the DM's preference ranking and expands on a new preference ranking method. Secondly, mixed stability definitions based on TrIT2FS are proposed to facilitate the description of different sanctioning behaviors of heterogeneous opponents. Subsequently, a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function is proposed to quickly obtain conflict evolution solutions in complex dynamic conflict problems based on the extended mixed stability definitions. Finally, to thoroughly test the correctness and practicality of the proposed theory, the conflict between inputs and outputs of the technological transformation of enterprises under the low-carbon strategy is used as a specific application scenario and example for validation.",

Evaluation studies have emerged to assess their abilities, with the majority focusing on the third-person perspective, and only a few addressing specific tasks from the first-person per-spective. However, the capability of VLMs to \u201cthink\u201d from a first-person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce EgoThink, a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from ego-centric videos, with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs, we evaluate twenty-one popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover, given the open-ended format of the answers, we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions, all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile, enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion, EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs, providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics.",

Although image-language models can efficiently represent both video and language branches, they typically employ goal-free vision perception and do not interact vision with language well during the answer generation, thus omitting crucial visual cues. In this paper, we are inspired by the human recognition and learning pattern and propose VideoDistill, a framework with language-aware (i.e., goal-driven) behavior in both vision perception and answer generation. VideoDistill generates answers only from question-related visual embeddings and follows a thinking-observing-answering approach that closely resembles human behavior, distinguishing it from previous research. Specifically, we develop a language-aware gating mechanism to replace the standard cross-attention, avoiding language's direct fusion into visual representations. We incorporate this mechanism into two key components of the entire framework. The first component is a differentiable sparse sampling module, which selects frames containing the necessary dynamics and semantics relevant to the questions. The second component is a vision refinement module that merges existing spatial-temporal attention layers to ensure extracting multi-grained visual semantics associated with the questions. We conduct evaluations on various challenging video question-answering benchmarks, and VideoDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and long-form VideoQA datasets. In Addition, we verify that VideoDistill can effectively alleviate the utilization of language shortcut solutions in the EgoTaskQA dataset.",

Seeing the visible of the hidden is called amodal completion; however, this task remains a challenge for generative AI despite rapid progress. We propose to sidestep many of the difficulties of existing approaches, which typically involve a two-step process of predicting amodal masks and then generating pixels. Our method involves thinking outside the box, literally! We go outside the object bounding box to use its context to guide a pretrained diffusion inpainting model, and then progressively grow the occluded object and trim the extra background. We overcome two technical challenges: 1) how to be free of unwanted co-occurrence bias, which tends to regenerate similar occluders, and 2) how to judge if an amodal completion has succeeded. Our amodal completion method exhibits improved photorealistic completion results compared to existing approaches in numerous successful completion cases. And the best part?

Conducting user preference studies is an alternative that offers both adaptability and human-aligned results. User studies, however, can be very ex-pensive to scale. This paper presents an automatic, ver-satile, and human-aligned evaluation metric for text-to-3D generative models.

We further design a method instructing GPT-4V to compare two 3D assets according to user-defined crite-ria. Finally, we use these pairwise comparison results to assign these models Elo ratings.

Recently, progress has been made in image reconstruction with non-invasive brain recordings, but it's still difficult to generate realistic images with high semantic fidelity due to the scarcity of data annotations. Unlike previous methods, this work casts the neural decoding into optimal transport (OT) and representation decoupling problems. Specifically, under discrete OT theory, we design a graph matching-guided neural representation learning framework to seek the underlying correspondences between conceptual semantics and neural signals, which yields a natural and meaningful self-supervisory task. Moreover, the proposed MindArt, structured with multiple stand-alone modal branches, enables the seamless incorporation of semantic representation into any visual style information, thus leaving it to have multi-modal reconstruction and training-free semantic editing capabilities. By doing so, the reconstructed images of MindArt have phenomenal realism both in terms of semantics and appearance. We compare our MindArt with leading alternatives, and achieve SOTA performance in different decoding tasks.

Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term \u201cType I hallucinations\u201d. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term \u201cType II hallucinations\u201d. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.",

Because the A * algorithm has strong search ability, clear algorithm thinking, and can be constrained to the global optimal path, it has the advantages of high efficiency, stability and optimality. Therefore, a motion trajectory planning method based on A * algorithm is proposed for mobile robots. Firstly, this paper analyzes several commonly used mobile robot path planning algorithms, and selects the A * algorithm as the object of this study. Secondly, the working principle, advantages and disadvantages of the A * algorithm are introduced in detail, as well as the design modules of the A * algorithm. Then, the problem of motion trajectory planning for mobile robots is analyzed and a solution is proposed. Aiming at the problems of low planning efficiency, turning path, sharp and unsmooth path, the efficiency and stability of A * algorithm are optimized by adding heuristic algorithm, corner optimization and path smoothing. Finally, the working environment of the mobile robot is established by using the grid method, and the path planning simulation experiment is carried out on the MATLAB platform. The experimental results show that the method of path planning using A * algorithm is effective and has a wide application prospect.",

        "abstract": "The use of wireless control systems for human-computer interaction has grown in popularity recently. Earlier, people used to stick to input tools like a keyboard or mouse, which restrict one\u2019s movement and interaction options, but now, newer technologies like computer vision, machine learning and AI have opened new and interactive ways of interacting with computers. This paper presents a hand gestures approach that not only can control presentations but is also useful for facilitating drawing and managing system volume which enrich the user experience and engagement by offering an interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse. With the help of this algorithm, the computer system accurately responds to hand movements in real time. With this model, one can easily navigate through slides, play, or pause videos, and perform multiple presentation related tasks using hand gestures. It boosts mobility and enhances audience engagement by removing the limitations posed by traditional input methods. It also allows users to digitally draw on the system. Users can sketch diagrams, annotate slides, and unleash their creativity without requiring drawing tablets. It uses Google\u2019s mediapipe module to detect hand landmarks. We incorporated specific gestures that enable the model to initiate a particular action. It showed an accuracy of $\\mathbf{9 8 \\%}$ under normal lighting conditions, which slightly drops to $95 \\%$ and $\\mathbf{9 6 \\%}$ in low and bright light, respectively, while the overall accuracy remains at $96.33 \\%$.",

        "abstract": "In today's data-driven world, the importance of data literacy is paramount. However, software engineering education has not adequately addressed integrating comprehensive data science curricula, leaving students ill-equipped for the future of artificial intelligence (AI), which is built on the foundations of data science. This gap is exacerbated by the lack of tailored courses and the intimidating nature of existing tools for begin-ners. Consequently, students often miss out on essential skills like data cleanup, real-world application of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the integration of big data in software products. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach to applied data science for software engineering students. We argue for a shift from traditional algorithm-focused teaching to a curriculum emphasizing real-world problem-solving, lever-aging data science techniques. By empowering students to define and tackle their own data-driven projects, we aim to increase motivation, enhance data literacy, and instill a data-thinking mindset in future software engineers to prepare them for the AI world. Overall, this paper contributes to the advancement of software engineering education for young learners by offering a comprehensive framework, the data action educational framework (DAEF), and a data science toolkit that enables DAEF by empowering learners to create original data-driven mobile apps.",

Therefore, different methods have been proposed for analyzing confidence in AI. In our research, we set out to evaluate how the degree of perceived trust in an AI system could affect a user\u2019s final decision to follow AI recommendations. To this end, we established trustworthy criteria that such an evaluation should meet by following a co-creation approach with a multidisciplinary group of 10 experts. After a systematic review of 3,204 articles, we found that none of the tools met the inclusion criteria. Thus, we introduce the so-called \u201cPerceived Operational Trust Degree in AI\u201d (POTDAI) tool that is based on the findings from the expert group and the literature analysis, with a methodology that adds rigor to that employed previously to create similar evaluation tools. We propose a short questionnaire for quick and easy application, inspired by the original version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with six Likert-type items. In this way, we also respond to the need pointed out by authors such as Vorm and Combs to extend the TAM to address questions related to user perception in systems with an AI component. Thus, POTDAI can be used alone or in combination with TAM to obtain additional information on its usefulness and ease of use.",

It is essential to explore the reasons driving people of all ages to consider suicide and find ways to encourage them to choose life instead. In the modern era, social media acts as a crucial platform where people share their thoughts, activities, and emotional states. This has led to the consideration of whether analyzing social media posts could help discern whether individuals are experiencing joy or sadness, particularly to detect levels of sadness that could indicate suicidal thoughts. This paper employs artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to analyze the social media posts of individuals to gauge their mental state, specifically targeting signs that might indicate a risk of suicide. The study has found a high frequency of suicidal thoughts among those who appear depressed on social media. This research investigated the possibility to identify the likelihood of someone contemplating suicidal through their online behavior. This research demonstrates the potential of utilizing social media analysis to identify and support individuals at risk of suicide, providing new insights into recognizing and assessing suicidal thoughts and representing a significant advancement in suicide prevention efforts.",

The evaluation of CT has become a crucial concern for educators and researchers. Currently., while extensive research has investigated the assessment of students' CT conceptual understanding., the measurement of their thinking processes is less involved. The game-based assessment appears to address this issue by analyzing students' behaviors and reactions during the gameplay process., which has become an emerging assessment tool in CT education. This drives the need for a comprehensive overview of this field. To fill this gap., this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review on the assessment of CT through games. It explores CT skills assessed through games., focusing on target groups, game forms., and benefits. A total of fifteen studies were examined. Findings indicate that algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, pattern recognition., and abstraction were commonly assessed in games. Different ways for assessing CT skills in games were identified, involving progression level, log data, and manual coding. The benefits of CT game-based assessments were broadly reported, such as enjoyable experiences for students, instant feedback, easy administration for teachers and researchers, and richer information on students' cognitive processes. However, limited has been done in exploring the use of digital games for younger age groups, and the psychometric qualities of the tools were hardly reported in the reviewed studies. The study sheds light on the research and teaching practices in using games and interactive assessment platforms in CT education.",

        "abstract": "Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.",

Diagnosing dementia early is important because it can greatly improve patients\u2019 lives. This systematic review looks at how deep learning (DL) techniques have been used to diagnose dementia automatically from 2012 to 2023. We explore how different DL methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are used to diagnose types of dementia such as Alzheimer\u2019s, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia. We also discuss the difficulties of using DL for diagnosing dementia, like the lack of large and varied datasets and the challenge of applying models to different groups of people. These issues indicate the need for more dependable and understandable models that consider a wide range of patient characteristics and biomarkers. Longitudinal studies are also needed to understand how the disease progresses and how treatments work. Collaboration among researchers, doctors, and data scientists is crucial to ensure DL models are scientifically sound and effective in clinical settings. In summary, DL techniques show promise for automated dementia diagnosis and could improve how accurately and efficiently it is diagnosed in practice. However, further research is needed to address the challenges highlighted in this review.",

        "abstract": "With the extensive application of wood-based panels in the home decor industry, determining formaldehyde release form wood-based panels (FRWBP) is crucial for ensuring environmental air quality and human health. This article addresses the issues of insufficient monitoring of the testing stages for FRWBP and the difficulty in tracing the operation records of operator during determining FRWBP by the chamber method. It proposes a system for monitoring and analyzing the testing stages of FRWBP based on electrical monitoring. The system employs non-invasive sensing technology that does not interfere with normal testing process to collect real-time electrical usage data from the devices. The data is uploaded to an industrial computer for storage and processing. Statistical features of the electrical time series data are extracted using a sliding window approach and optimized with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Subsequently, the binary tree support vector machine algorithm (BTSVM) optimized by k-means clustering algorithm is used to identify the detection states of the wood-based panels. Experimental results show that the system can achieve traceability of the formaldehyde detection stage records of artificial boards, and the designed algorithm model can also effectively identify the detection status of wood-based panels.

We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students\u2019 solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students\u2019 solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students\u2019 solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students\u2019 solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students\u2019 solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.",

        "abstract": "Entrepreneurship education is critical in encouraging students' innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit. It provides essential skills and knowledge, enabling them to open their creative potential and apply innovative thinking across diverse professional fields. With the widespread application of large language models in education, intelligent-assisted teaching in entrepreneurship education is stepping into a new learning phase anytime and anywhere. Entrepreneurship education extends across interdisciplinary knowledge fields, incorporating subjects like finance and risk management, which require advanced mathematical computational skills. This complexity presents new challenges for artificial-intelligence-assisted question-and-answer models. The study explores how students can maximize the knowledge repository of current large language models to improve learning efficiency and experimentally validates the performance differences between large language models and graph convolutional reasoning models regarding the complex semantic reasoning and mathematical computational demands in entrepreneurship education questions. Based on case studies, it is found that despite the broad prospects of large language models in entrepreneurship education, they still need to improve in practical applications. Especially in tasks within entrepreneurship education that demand precision, such as mathematical computations and risk assessment, the accuracy and efficiency of existing models still need improvement. Therefore, further exploration into algorithm optimization, model fusion, and other technical enhancements can improve the processing capabilities of intelligent question-and-answer systems for specific domain issues, aiming to meet the practical needs of entrepreneurship education.",

However, in many times, most people simply take the model and apply it, never thinking about its generalization ability in the projects where it belongs to, that is, whether the performance of the model will continue to be excellent in different application scenarios and completely different dataset structures. This work mainly tested the generalization ability of two models. By using a dataset for model training, a brand-new dataset is introduced into the trained model to test its generalization ability. If it is found that the generalization ability is not high, our model is optimized to improve its generalization ability as much as possible. After optimization, their generalization ability (represented by precision improvement here, as explained below) has significantly improved, from 38.56% to 100.00% and from 40.24% to 54.79% respectively.",

As a self-report evaluation scale for pupils, this evaluation framework further enriched the CT assessment instruments for pupils and provided a specialized instrument for experts to evaluate pupils\u2019 CT in problem-solving situations during classroom learning.  Background: CT cultivation and assessment methods are hot topics in the field of education. CT assessment can effectively test the effect of CT cultivation. There are many CT assessment methods, of which evaluation frameworks are an effective self-reporting assessment method. Existing studies on self-reported CT evaluation frameworks are commonly applicable to students at different stages. However, few studies have focused on the specific context from the perspective of practice for pupils. Thus, the evaluation framework of pupils\u2019 CT is worth exploring.  Intended Outcomes: A CT evaluation framework for evaluating pupils\u2019 CT in problem-solving situations in classroom learning was constructed to facilitate researchers\u2019 understanding of pupils\u2019 CT levels and problem-solving skills.  Application Design: In this study, data from 897 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades were collected using an online questionnaire that included 27 items about CT. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item analysis were conducted to analyze the data in this study, with 17 items remaining in the final evaluation framework.  Findings: The fitting validity, convergence validity, and discriminant validity all met the recommended criteria, which showed that the evaluation framework was effective. The total reliability of CT was 0.911, indicating that the consistency and reliability of the evaluation framework constructed in this study were satisfied.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach was proposed to develop a composition generation system for creating note sequences representing question-and-answer phrases (QAPs) in melodic phrases. Using a small dataset containing fewer than 10 compositions, the system is expected to generate new melodies that extend beyond the limitations of the original dataset. The modeling of note sequence data and selecting appropriate notes in specific sequences within the melody were chosen for gamelan skeletal melody generation using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) method. Gamelan, a traditional musical ensemble from Java, was selected as the focus of this research, with experiments centered on the gamelan skeletal melody, which plays a role similar to chord progressions in Western music. The evaluation was conducted by statistically analyzing the sequence of notations generated from the dataset and through expert testing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate compositions with well-formed melodic phrases through a small dataset containing varying lengths, data mapping, feature selection based on QAP patterns, and GA. GA can enhance creativity in creating note sequences and new QAP patterns, including novel patterns.",

Despite the surprising zero-shot or few-shot ability, it is also required to effectively fine-tune pre-trained language models for specific downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce CaptionT5, a video captioning model that fine-tunes T5 towards understanding videos and generating descriptive captions. To generate a more corespondent caption, CaptionT5 introduces thought-augmented fine-tuning for video captioning, in which a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on thought-augmented video inputs. This resembles the process that human see a video, think of visual concepts such as objects and actions, and then tell a correct and natural sentence based on the thoughts. To automatically generate thoughts, we propose (1) CLIP-guided thought sampling that samples thoughts based on the similarity in an image-text multimodal embedding space by leveraging CLIP. We also propose (2) CLIP-guided caption ranking during decoding for further performance gains. Through experimentation on VATEX, MSRVTT, and YC2 datasets, we empirically demonstrate that CaptionT5 performs competitively against prior-art video captioning approaches without using encoders specialized for video data. Further experiments show that CaptionT5 is especially effective under small number of sampled video frames.",

        "abstract": "Making neuro-inspired structures more resistant to common difficulties is the focus of this study. AI and deep learning are crucial in many fields; therefore, neural networks must be reliable and durable. This post proposes a robust framework using 10 advanced tactics for a new and complete robustness approach. Our technique uses dropout, gradient masking, transfer learning, adversarial training, randomized smoothing, input preparation, strong activation functions, ensemble learning, Bayesian neural networks, and gradient masking. These strategies are aimed at addressing hostile assaults, noise, and environmental changes. Combining these approaches makes the system more versatile, making it ideal for self-driving vehicles, medical diagnostics, and hacking. We conducted comprehensive research to evaluate the proposed method\u2019s accuracy, durability, resistance, generalization, computational cost, and real-world usage. Line charts illustrate the method\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. These numbers demonstrate how the proposed approach differs from previous ones. They demonstrate its versatility and efficacy. Finally, our results demonstrate a reliable, versatile, and proven method for neural network resilience. Our method handles common modifications using sophisticated methods. This yields a forward-thinking, effective solution to AI environmental changes. The reliability of neuro-inspired systems has improved, which will affect artificial intelligence.",

        "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has recently shown good performance in solving large-scale sensing tasks. As an essential topic in MCS, recommending tasks to participants has received extensive attention from researchers. Most studies assume that participants are absolutely rational, which is unrealistic because it is difficult for participants to know all the information about the transaction. Furthermore, most of them do not consider how to learn the preferences of new participants. In addition, their works are difficult to extend to different MCS scenarios. Considering the above problems, we propose an extensible bounded rationality-based task recommendation scheme (EBRTR), which contains a task recommendation framework and a bounded rationality decision-making model. First, a task recommendation framework that can be easily extended to various MCS scenarios is designed. Second, in our bounded rationality decision-making model, for participants with historical task information, according to the implicit information in their historical tasks, the human thinking mode with bounded rationality is simulated, and the improved classification and regression tree (ICART) algorithm is designed to construct the decision tree. For participants who newly join the platform, social information is introduced to construct an initial decision tree. Finally, extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "The soroban is a traditional arithmetic tool whose life in modern Japan reflected an inherently material dimension of computational numeracy. Using a system of commands to carry out operations, the soroban was both doubted and enthusiastically embraced by educators as a way of teaching basic mathematics, sparking conversations of what it really meant to understand arithmetic. Despite the introduction of Western-style pen and paper arithmetic, it persisted as the standard tool of computing in households, businesses, and bureaucracy, driving the Taylorist training of human calculators who could apply its commands with corporal discipline and the design of mechanical calculators that simplified its procedures. Even when educators held an \u201cintuitive\u201d ideal of mental calculation that moved students away from calculating with physical tools, the soroban persevered as a virtual interface that calculators accessed in their minds.",

This is usually the case when the underlying security policy implements both permission and prohibition rules. In this paper, we propose to capture uncertainty in security models, within the framework of possibility theory. We define efficient strategies for handling conflicting privileges derived by a security policy, based on priorities assigned to the permissions and prohibitions. We show that these strategies are in line with the possibilistic management of inconsistency in security policies.",

        "abstract": "Publisher Summary\nThis chapter introduced multi-GPU programming, which is one of the most exciting areas of research and application development in GPU computing. CUDA was designed to exploit the massive parallelism inside the GPU as well as through the use of concurrent streams of execution to utilize multiple GPUs, asynchronous data transfers, and simultaneous kernel execution on a single device. By explicitly creating and using multiple streams of execution, a CUDA programmer can perform more work per unit time to make applications run faster. Under special circumstances, greater efficiency per device can be achieved when running multiple streams on a single device to exploit concurrent kernel execution. CUDA programmers can overlap computation and data transfers to reduce application runtime plus enable real-time data processing on both single and multi-GPU systems. Current technology allows up to 16 GPUs devices to be installed in a single workstation or computational node. Data partitioning and scalability are key challenges for multi-GPU application development. Still to be discussed is MPI programming for distributed GPU clusters. With this technology, CUDA programmers can scale to literally thousands of GPU devices to address big computational problems. It also creates opportunities to perform \u201cleadership\u201d- class computations on some of the largest super-computers in the world.",

        "abstract": "In thinking about complexity, it's frequently invoked that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This notion serves as one of the motivating principles of systems biology, which seeks to understand the emergent properties of complex biological systems. Among many biologists, systems biology is also synonymous with the use of particular approaches, including high-throughput techniques, large-scale integration of datasets, and computational modeling to probe system behaviors. There is indeed little doubt that the recent growth of the field has been fueled by the massive expansion in the amount of data being generated in the biological sciences\u2014first from genome sequencing and more recently from such sources as transcriptomics, proteomics, and high-throughput imaging. Given this rising tide of data, there is an urgent need for new ways of analyzing large datasets and for conceptualizing biological complexity. It is in this context that we present our 2011 Special Review Issue on systems biology. The overarching goal of this collection is to highlight biological insights revealed by the quantitative and computational approaches associated with systems biology. To accomplish this, the issue includes topics that span vastly different size and time scales, from protein-protein interactions to disease models, from transcriptional dynamics to evolutionary processes. For the issue's diversity, depth, and thought-provoking insights, we would like to thank the many distinguished authors and reviewers who generously contributed their time and effort. In reading the issue, we hope that you will find that the collection, like biological systems, is more than the sum of its individual parts, providing a new perspective on this rapidly changing field.",

        "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has always been an important research topic for applying artificial intelligence in smart healthcare. Sufficient medical data are one of the most critical factors in CAD research. However, medical data are usually obtained in chronological order and cannot be collected all at once, which poses difficulties for the application of deep learning technology in the medical field. The traditional batch learning method consumes considerable time and space resources for real-time medical data, and the incremental learning method often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To solve these problems, we propose a real-time medical data processing method based on federated learning. We divide the process into the model stage and the exemplar stage. In the model stage, we use the federated learning method to fuse the old and new models to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. In the exemplar stage, we use the most representative exemplars selected from the old data to help the new model review the old knowledge, which further mitigates the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. We use this method to conduct experiments on a simulated medical real-time data stream. The experimental results show that our method can learn a disease diagnosis model from a continuous medical real-time data stream. As the amount of data increases, the performance of the disease diagnosis model continues to improve, and the catastrophic forgetting problem has been effectively mitigated. Compared with the traditional batch learning method, our method can significantly save time and space resources.",

Human\u2013robot interaction (HRI) therefore provides an important applied setting for human behavior modeling\u2014but given the vast complexity of human behavior, how complete and accurate do these models need to be? Here, we outline some possible ways of thinking about this problem, starting from the suggestion that modelers need to keep the right end goal in sight: a successful HRI, in terms of safety, performance, and human satisfaction. Efforts toward model completeness and accuracy should be focused on those aspects of human behavior to which interaction success is most sensitive.",

        "abstract": "The success of modern single image super-resolution (SISR) algorithms is inspired by the development of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, these CNN-based methods require considerable computation and complexity, making it impossible for these methods to perform real-time calculations in edge devices. Thus, lightweight model design has become a development trend in the super-resolution field, including pruning, quantization, and other methods. The 1-bit quantization is an extreme lightweight method which can reduce the calculation amount of the model in an extreme manner and is friendly to hardware such as edge devices. Most existing binary quantization approaches lead to a large information loss during forward propagation, especially in detailed color information (e.g., edge, texture, and contrast). The loss of color information makes modern binary methods unsuitable for SISR tasks. We think the loss occurs because these methods typically utilize a uniform threshold to quantize the weights and activations. Thus, in this article, we thoroughly analyze the difference between normal classification tasks and SISR tasks, and present a binarization scheme based on local means. The proposed method can maintain more detailed information in feature maps using dynamic thresholds during quantization. Specifically, each value in the full precision activations has a corresponding threshold during the quantization process, and those thresholds are determined by the full precision values of the surroundings. In addition, a gradient approximator is introduced to adaptively optimize the gradient for updating binary weights. We then verify the effectiveness of our method for training binary networks on several SISR benchmarks including VDSR and SRResNet. Experimental results show that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms to obtain binary networks for image super-resolution with better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values and visual quality.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's is progressive and irreversible type of dementia, which causes degeneration and death of cells and their connections in the brain. AD worsens over time and greatly impacts patients\u2019 life and affects their important mental functions, including thinking, the ability to carry on a conversation, and judgment and response to environment. Clinically, there is no single test to effectively diagnose Alzheimer disease. However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be used to help in AD diagnosis by observing critical changes in the size of different brain areas, typically parietal and temporal lobes areas. In this work, an integrative mulitresolutional ensemble deep learning-based framework is proposed to achieve better predictive performance for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Unlike ResNet, DenseNet and their variants proposed pipeline utilizes PartialNet in a hierarchical design tailored to AD detection using brain MRIs. The advantage of the proposed analysis system is that PartialNet diversified the depth and deep supervision. Additionally, it also incorporates the properties of identity mappings which makes it powerful in better learning due to feature reuse. Besides, the proposed ensemble PartialNet is better in vanishing gradient, diminishing forward-flow with low number of parameters and better training time in comparison to its counter network. The proposed analysis pipeline has been tested and evaluated on benchmark ADNI dataset collected from 379 subjects patients. Quantitative validation of the obtained results documented our framework's capability, outperforming state-of-the-art learning approaches for both multi-and binary-class AD detection.",

        "abstract": "Teaching programming is a topic that has generated a high level of interest among researchers in recent decades. In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on \u201cLearning by Teaching,\u201d where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre\u2013posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students.",
